## Working in the code

If you want to contribute code, please:

* Follow the same [coding style](#format-check) as used in the project.
* Add an automated test that verifies your code change like described in the [Tests chapter](#tests).
* Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), explain what your patch does, and why it is needed. How to is described in the [Commit changes chapter](#commit-changes).
* Keep it simple: Any patch that changes a lot of code or is difficult to understand should be discussed before you put in the effort.

Once you have tried the above, create a GitHub pull request with your changes changes and feel awesome ðŸŽ‰.

Tested with Node 8 and NPM 5 and up. Also this site uses [gatsby static site generator][gburl].

### Setup

Clone the repo and run an install:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:MartinHelmut/martin-fieber.de.git && cd martin-fieber.de && npm install
```

After installation completed you can use the following command to start the development server:

```shell
npm run develop
```

### Tests

Tests are written in [Jest][jturl]. To run all tests execute

```shell
$ npm test
```

and to lint the code (JavaScript and CSS):

```shell
$ npm run lint
```

### Format check

You can also run a prettier verification for all JS files in all packages with:

```shell
$ npm run fmt:check
```

This will list changes that would be made on commit (commit hook is installed with husky).

```shell
$ git checkout -b task/do-something
```

**There is no specific naming convention for branches.**

Add your changes and run `npm run commit` to start the commitizen cli to create a proper commit message.

Create a "Pull Request" on Github and be awesome! ðŸ˜Ž

### Recommended workflow for release

1. Make changes
2. Commit those changes with `npm run commit`
3. Make sure all tests turn green with `npm test`
4. Push your changes!

[Netlify][nturl] will run `npm run build` and publish automatically after push.
