## Issues

### General

If you report a bug, please try to:

## Working in the code

- Follow the same [coding style](#format-check) as used in the project.
- Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), explain what your patch does, and why it is needed.
- Keep it simple: Any patch that changes a lot of code or is difficult to understand should be discussed before you put in the effort.

Once you have tried the above, create a GitHub pull request with your changes and feel awesome ðŸŽ‰.
