<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  When I started seriously learning C++ a couple of years ago, I struggled with
  a proper setup the most. Beginner tutorials often only use the command line,
  but lack in larger topics like build and dependency management. Where more
  advanced guides often assume greater knowledge with at least CMake already.
</p>
<p>
  Coming from web development, dependency management was one of the easier
  tasks, as simple as <code>npm install</code>. Nevertheless, building a web
  project got increasingly difficult over the years, assuming the usage of tools
  like
  <a
    href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"
    title="The official website for TypeScript"
    >TypeScript</a
  >, <a href="https://babeljs.io" title="Babel.js landing page">Babel</a>,
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org" title="The webpack project website"
    >webpack</a
  >
  and others. Of course there is still the option to not use any and go
  <em>"vanilla"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  As I started writing websites with Internet Explorer 5, I kinda grew up with
  those tools, naturally, as they emerged over the years. In contrast, coming
  into the large C++ ecosystem with a lot of tools and practices feels like
  hitting a wall with high speed. Stepping back, starting without tools, and
  trying to understand every tool I add first, at least on a basic level; that
  was the plan. And the tool I wanted to understand first was CMake &mdash;
  little I knew what a ride that will be.
</p>
<aside class="callout">
  <h4>Platform Support</h4>
  <p>
    I most often work on a M1 Mac, but I also tested this setup with Windows 11
    and on Linux (Debian).
  </p>
</aside>
<h3>Learning CMake</h3>
<p>
  I've heard a lot of things about
  <a href="https://cmake.org" title="Official CMake website">CMake</a>, a lot of
  those things were bad. Nevertheless, CMake seems to be a very dominant tool in
  C++ development, and I definitely wanted to understand it, at least good
  enough to feel comfortable using it.
</p>
<p>
  Searching the internet for resources I saw a lot of CMake code, solving the
  same problem in many ways. Initially I tried to combine what I found to reach
  my goals, but even with the little understanding of CMake I had this felt
  wrong. Not fully understanding the tool, I've got the same frustration
  probably many felt using CMake and its many versions. It was time to extend my
  CMake knowledge &mdash; I bought
  <a
    href="https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/"
    title="An amazing book tackling CMake as a whole"
    >Professional CMake: A Practical Guide</a
  >, that I've heard a lot of good things about. And the book was indeed an
  amazing source of knowledge. By the way, there is no affiliation, I just
  genuinely like the book.
</p>
<p>
  From here on I will show how I set up my environment for C++ development with
  CMake. It may not be the best, but it proved valuable for me multiple times
  and is, with my limited experience, my favourite choice developing in C++.
</p>
<h3>Application setup</h3>
<p>The minimal project setup looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">build/
  debug/
  release/
cmake/
  CompilerWarnings.cmake
  StandardProjectSettings.cmake
  StaticAnalyzers.cmake
  UniversalAppleBuild.cmake
src/
  app/
    App/
    CMakeLists.txt
  some_library/
    SomeLibrary/
    CMakeLists.txt
  CMakeLists.txt
CMakeLists.txt</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  Going through it step-by-step; the first folder
  <code>build</code> is to capture generated project files and the actual
  application build. The folder is
  <strong>excluded from source control</strong>. Inside are the different build
  artefacts for debug and release builds, but can also contain a different, or
  more granular, structure when building for multiple targets.
</p>
<h4>CMakeLists.txt</h4>
<p>The root <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

include(cmake/UniversalAppleBuild.cmake)

project(
  AppName
  DESCRIPTION "A description about the app."
  LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

include(cmake/StandardProjectSettings.cmake)

# Link project_warnings as "library" to use the warnings
# specified in CompilerWarnings.cmake.
add_library(project_warnings INTERFACE)
include(cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake)
set_project_warnings(project_warnings)

add_subdirectory(src)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The first line sets the minimum CMake version and can be any version for you,
  I like to use a rather recent version.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The next line includes a file inside the <code>cmake</code> folder.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">include(cmake/UniversalAppleBuild.cmake)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The file <code>UniversalAppleBuild.cmake</code> is used to generate universal
  builds for Apple Intel and Silicon. The contents are as follows:
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># cmake/UniversalAppleBuild.cmake

# Generate universal executable for Apple hardware.
# This file needs to be included before calling `project`.
if (APPLE AND RELEASE)
  set(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES "arm64;x86_64" CACHE STRING "")
endif ()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Next the project setup.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">project(
  AppName
  DESCRIPTION "A description about the app."
  LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  This will define the CMake project, give it a project name, a description and
  the language used; in this case C++20.
</p>
<h4>Standard project settings</h4>
<p>
  The next include, <code>StandardProjectSettings.cmake</code>, will define some
  common settings.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">include(cmake/StandardProjectSettings.cmake)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  It is located inside the <code>cmake</code> folder that will hold all CMake
  source files. In its basic form this files looks like this:
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># cmake/StandardProjectSettings.cmake

# Set a default build type if none was specified
if (NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE AND NOT CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
  message(
    STATUS
    "Setting build type to 'Debug' as none was specified.")
  set(
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug
    CACHE STRING "Choose the type of build." FORCE)

  # Set possible build type values for cmake-gui and ccmake
  set_property(
    CACHE CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    PROPERTY STRINGS "Debug" "Release")
endif ()

# Use ccache for faster rebuilds
find_program(CCACHE ccache)
if (CCACHE)
  message(STATUS "Using ccache")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER ${CCACHE})
else ()
  message(STATUS "Ccache not found")
endif ()

# Generate compile_commands.json to make it easier to work
# with clang based tools. Used in combination with Ninja.
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)

# Debug option that also enables asserts and profiling
option(DEBUG "Enable debug statements" OFF)
if (DEBUG OR CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")
  add_compile_definitions(
    APP_DEBUG APP_ENABLE_ASSERTS APP_PROFILE)
endif ()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  This will, if a Debug build is enabled, also define three compiler directives;
  <code>APP_DEBUG</code> to be used to enable debug build only code paths,
  <code>APP_ENABLE_ASSERTS</code> for assertions and
  <code>APP_PROFILE</code> for performance profiling. All are prefixed with
  <code>APP_</code>, representative for a more unique prefix, like your app name
  or a short form of it.
</p>
<h4 id="project-warnings">Project warnings</h4>
<p>Now comes the code quality part, or at least some of it.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># Link project_warnings as "library" to use the warnings
# specified in CompilerWarnings.cmake.
add_library(project_warnings INTERFACE)
include(cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake)
set_project_warnings(project_warnings)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  This looks like a hack, and it maybe is, but works like a charm. I create an
  empty interface called
  <code>project_warnings</code> and include another file,
  <code>CompilerWarnings.cmake</code>, that will create a function
  <code>set_project_warnings</code> that takes a <em>"library"</em> name and
  attaches a set of compiler options to it via CMake's
  <code>target_compile_options</code>. I then can use this
  <code>project_warnings</code>
  interface and link it as a library to my app and libraries I want to build.
</p>
<p>
  Here a shortened look inside the
  <code>CompilerWarnings.cmake</code> file with some added comments for
  clarification (the long version can be found
  <a
    href="https://github.com/MartinHelmut/cpp-base-template/blob/main/cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake"
    title="CMake file with compiler warnings"
    >here</a
  >).
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake

# This will define the `set_project_warnings` function
# that takes the interface name.
function(set_project_warnings project_name)
  # I always treat warnings as errors, making my life easier
  # in the long run.
  option(
    WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS
    "Treat compiler warnings as errors" TRUE)
  message(STATUS "Treat compiler warnings as errors")

  set(MSVC_WARNINGS
    # Baseline reasonable warnings
    /W4
    # Whatever other MSVC compiler warnings you want.
    # ...
    )

  set(CLANG_WARNINGS
    # Reasonable and standard
    -Wall
    -Wextra
    # Whatever other CLang compiler warnings you want.
    # ...
    )

  # Stop the build if there are any warnings,
  if (WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS)
    set(CLANG_WARNINGS ${CLANG_WARNINGS} -Werror)
    set(MSVC_WARNINGS ${MSVC_WARNINGS} /WX)
  endif ()

  set(GCC_WARNINGS
    ${CLANG_WARNINGS}
    # Whatever other GCC compiler warnings you want.
    # ...
    )

  # Enable the right set of warnings depending on
  # the used compiler.
  if (MSVC)
    set(PROJECT_WARNINGS ${MSVC_WARNINGS})
  elseif (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES ".*Clang")
    set(PROJECT_WARNINGS ${CLANG_WARNINGS})
  elseif (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU")
    set(PROJECT_WARNINGS ${GCC_WARNINGS})
  else ()
    message(
      AUTHOR_WARNING
      "No compiler warnings set for '${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}' compiler.")
  endif ()

  # This will "link" the warnings to the defined
  # project name, in my case "project_warnings".
  target_compile_options(
    ${project_name} INTERFACE ${PROJECT_WARNINGS})
endfunction()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The last line inside the root <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is to include
  the source directory.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">add_subdirectory(src)</code></pre>
</figure>
<h4>Source structure</h4>
<p>
  The <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder contains
  two lines, one to include the library folder and one for the app. This is
  dependent on the amount of applications and libraries in your project.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># src/CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory(some_library)
add_subdirectory(app)</code></pre>
</figure>
<h3>Defining a library</h3>
<p>
  Now let's have a look at the
  <code>src/some_library/CMakeLists.txt</code> file.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># src/some_library/CMakeLists.txt
set(NAME "SomeLibrary")

include(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/StaticAnalyzers.cmake)

add_library(${NAME} STATIC
  SomeLibrary/SomeFile.cpp SomeLibrary/SomeFile.hpp)

target_include_directories(
  ${NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
target_compile_features(${NAME} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_link_libraries(${NAME} PRIVATE project_warnings)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>The first line is, for convenience, the definition of the library name.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">set(NAME "SomeLibrary")</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  Then I include a file I add to every library as well as the app,
  <code>StaticAnalyzers.cmake</code>.
</p>
<h4 id="static-analysis">Static analysis</h4>
<p>
  The <code>StaticAnalyzers.cmake</code> file inside the
  <code>cmake</code> folder enables
  <a
    href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html"
    title="More information about clang-tidy"
    >clang-tidy</a
  >
  (if installed) and the
  <a
    href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html"
    title="More information about AddressSanitizer"
    >address sanitizer</a
  >
  for debug builds.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># cmake/StaticAnalyzers.cmake
if (NOT RELEASE)
  find_program(CLANGTIDY clang-tidy)
  if (CLANGTIDY)
    message(STATUS "Using clang-tidy")
    set(CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY ${CLANGTIDY})
  else ()
    message(SEND_ERROR "clang-tidy requested but executable not found")
  endif ()

  message(STATUS "Using address sanitizer")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
    "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -O0 -fsanitize=address -g")
endif ()</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The clang-tidy options are defined in a
  <code>.clang-tidy</code> file at the project root.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-yaml hljs"># .clang-tidy

</figure>
<p>
  As many projects there are options, and this set of options is only mine. You
  can find a list of
  <a
    href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html"
    title="Complete list of checks for clang-tidy"
    >all checks for clang-tidy here</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Library files and build settings</h4>
<p>Next some source files:</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">add_library(${NAME} STATIC
  SomeLibrary/SomeFile.cpp SomeLibrary/SomeFile.hpp)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  This will add needed source files to create a static library. I like splitting
  my code into smaller libraries, like <em>"core"</em>,
  <em>"<abbr title="user interface">ui</abbr>"</em>, <em>"rendering"</em>, etc.
  to <strong>create logical chunks</strong>, but also
  <strong>keep build times lower</strong>. This is due to only libraries with
  changed files need to be rebuilt, otherwise they will only be linked.
</p>
<p>
  At last, setting the <em>"include directory"</em>, building with C++20, and
  linking the <code>project_warnings</code> as mentioned
  <a
    href="#project-warnings"
    title="Have a look at the previously mentioned project warnings."
    >earlier</a
  >.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">target_include_directories(${NAME}
  PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
target_compile_features(${NAME} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_link_libraries(${NAME} PRIVATE project_warnings)</code></pre>
</figure>
<h3>Defining an application</h3>
<p>
  Alas, a look at the <code>src/app/CMakeLists.txt</code> file and how to define
  an executable.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># src/app/CMakeLists.txt
set(NAME "App")

include(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/StaticAnalyzers.cmake)

add_executable(${NAME} App/Main.cpp)

target_include_directories(${NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
target_compile_features(${NAME} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_link_libraries(${NAME} PRIVATE project_warnings SomeLibrary)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Same as for the library, it defines a name for convenience.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">set(NAME "App")</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  Again, adding
  <a
    href="#static-analysis"
    title="Have a look again at the section about static analysis"
    >static analysers</a
  >
  to the app.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">include(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/StaticAnalyzers.cmake)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Throw in all app source files.</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">add_executable(${NAME} App/Main.cpp)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  And define the <em>"include directory"</em> and the C++ standard to build
  with.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">target_include_directories(${NAME}
  PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
target_compile_features(${NAME} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  Besides linking the <code>project_warnings</code> as mentioned
  <a
    href="#project-warnings"
    title="Have a look at the general project warninhgs again."
    >earlier</a
  >, I also link the libraries I want to use with the application by name; in
  that case my example <code>SomeLibrary</code>.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs">target_link_libraries(${NAME}
  PRIVATE project_warnings SomeLibrary)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  And that's about it to define an application. This setup supports multiple
  applications sharing the same (or different) libraries. Making this a kind of
  <strong>mono repository</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Adding dependencies</h3>
<p>
  How about the big topic dependencies? This was my greatest issue when starting
  C++, first using Git submodules, directly throwing source files into the
  project, failing at using
  <a href="https://conan.io" title="Official Conan website">Conan</a>, and many
  other attempts. Though, finally I settled on using CMake's
  <a
    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html"
    title="CMake documentation about FetchContent"
    >FetchContent</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>Adding fmtlib</h4>
<p>
  The way I structure dependencies is by having a
  <code>vendor</code> folder in the root of the project containing a
  <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> and one folder per dependency with another
  <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. Adding
  <a
    href="https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html"
    title="Documentation website about fmtlib"
    >{fmt}</a
  >
  to the project structure looks like this:
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">build/
cmake/
src/
vendor/
  fmt/
    CMakeLists.txt
  CMakeLists.txt
CMakeLists.txt</code></pre>
  <figcaption>Minified view of the folder structure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  First, I include the <code>vendor</code> folder inside the root
  <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

# Other CMake code

add_subdirectory(src)
add_subdirectory(vendor)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The dependency <code>vendor/fmt/CMakeLists.txt</code> file contains a message
  for fetching the dependency, potential dependency settings and the statement
  to make the dependency available to the project.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># vendor/fmt/CMakeLists.txt
message(STATUS "Fetching fmt ...")

# Here you can define build settings for fmt.

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(fmt)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The <code>vendor/CMakeLists.txt</code> file declares the actual dependency and
  the version to fetch (and from where).
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># vendor/CMakeLists.txt
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  fmt
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git"
  GIT_TAG 9.0.0
)
add_subdirectory(fmt)</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  It includes the <code>FetchContent</code> module from CMake, then declares a
  dependency by giving it a name, what Git repository to use and the Git tag (or
  alternatively a commit hash). At last, it adds the dependency subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
  With
  <a
    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#command:fetchcontent_declare"
    title="CMake documentation about FetchContent_Declare"
    >FetchContent_Declare</a
  >
  not only Git repositories can be used, also
  <abbr title="Apache Subversion">SVN</abbr> or any <abbr>URL</abbr> really
  containing an archive (e.g. a tar.gz file).
</p>
<p>
  The benefit with FetchContent is that dependencies are fetched only once on
  configure time, not on every build as with other solutions.
</p>
<h3>Build and run</h3>
<p>
  Before building the project, the CMake configuration step needs to be
  executed, looking like this for the debug setup (using
  <a href="https://ninja-build.org" title="Official Ninja build website"
    >Ninja</a
  >
  to build the project):
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-shell hljs">$ cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build/debug</code></pre>
  <figcaption>
    The <code>$</code> is used to show a command will be entered.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Building the project:</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-shell hljs">$ cmake --build build/debug</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Alas, running the generated executable (under Mac in that case):</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-shell hljs">$ ./build/debug/src/app/App</code></pre>
</figure>
<h3>Project formatting</h3>
<p>
  Being used to
  <a href="https://prettier.io" title="Official Prettier website">Prettier</a>
  I wanted something similar for C++, seeing
  <a
    href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html"
    title="Webpage about the clang-format tooling"
    >clang-format</a
  >
  as a worthy replacement. Adding a <code>.clang-format</code> file to the
  project root containing some basic formatting options.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-yaml hljs"># .clang-format

<h3>Bonus: Litr</h3>
<p>
  As biased as I am, of course I use my own project
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr"
    title="GitHub page of Litr, the Language Independent Task Runner."
    >Litr</a
  >
  to define some common commands for the project. Adding a

  building, running and formatting the project.

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>
  That's about it when it comes the base setup. I do actually have a little
  more, namely tests via
  <a
    href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest"
    title="GitHub page for doctest, the unit testing framework."

  >, but wanted to spare the setup here to keep it short. Nevertheless, this and
  a full example of the setup can be found on GitHub.
