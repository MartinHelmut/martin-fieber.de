<h3>Learning 3D modelling</h3>
<p>
  This year I was able to really dive into some topics I always wanted to, the
  biggest of which was learning 3D modelling. I always wanted to, but felt that
  this is an area of expertise too big and complicated for me to master &mdash;
  <strong>I was intimidated</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, it was one of my goals for <time>2022</time> to really learn 3D,
  so I started. A tutorial here, some experiments there,
  <a
    href="/series/bulkhead-door-with-blender"
    title="Overview of the 3D Bulkhead series."
    >starting a bigger project</a
  >. Learning about modelling, <abbr>UVs</abbr>, texturing, baking, and
  animation, and I’m loving it. It is still intimidating, though a challenge I
  like to take.
</p>

<h3>Starting a blog</h3>
<p>
  I also wanted to blog, so I created this blog in the
  <a
    href="/blog/my-blog"
    title="My first post about my blog and what to expect."
    ><time datetime="2022-01-11">11th of January</time> with my first three
    posts</a
  >. Though, I wrote nothing for a while until I agreed with a friend to post at
  least once a month, to push ourselves. And lo and behold, this actually
  helped.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I have created <strong>at least one post per month</strong>,
  sometimes more. Writing about code, me learning 3D,
  <a
    href="/blog/cassette-futurism"
    title="My appreciation for cassette futurism."
    >cassette futurism</a
  >, or whatever came to mind. At first, I just wanted to blog to get better at
  writing; looking back at previous posts, I'm quite happy with my progress on
  that, but over time, it became genuine <strong>fun</strong>. Blogging pushed
  me to learn new things, and learning helped me write new posts that reinforced
  my learning.
</p>

<h3>Changing my job</h3>
<p>
  When my wife and I moved to Sweden in <time>2019</time>, I started a job at
  <a href="https://www.klarna.com/" title="Website of my previous employer."
    >Klarna</a
  >. I am infinitely grateful for the opportunity and help to get settled in,
  but I was nonetheless looking for something else after 3 years. I was on a
  great team, but professionally I was looking for something different, changing
  direction for what I wanted to do in the future &mdash; back to tool
  development and a stronger focus on learning C++. At the end of
  <time datetime="2022-04">April 2022</time>, I left Klarna and joined King
  <time datetime="2022-05">a month later</time>.
</p>
<p>
  I love games, I love tools, and I want to learn more C++.
  <strong
    ><a href="https://www.king.com" title="Website of my current employer."
      >King</a
    >
    gave me all of that</strong
  >. Even though it is still <em>"fresh"</em> after half a year, I found an
  amazing company and team and all the support I need for my future. I even went
  into parental leave for two months after I started, with full support from
  everyone, always giving me the feeling that my family and my well-being are
  priorities.
</p>

<h3>Continued learning C++</h3>
<p>
  One of my goals for <time>2022</time> was to take learning C++ seriously, and
  besides changing jobs to leverage this on a professional level, I studied a
  lot in my free time, or rather at night when my daughter was asleep. Not all
  the time, only when I felt like it, as family has priority and there are other
  things I wanted to learn as well, on top of reading, gaming, and so on. Still,
  it took a lot of time to broaden my skill set.
</p>
<p>
  If I had to pick just one book I've read over the year that I come back to
  again and again, it would be <strong>Beautiful C++</strong> by
  <a href="https://github.com/hatcat" title="GitHub profile of J. Davidson."
    >J. Davidson</a
  >
  and
  <a href="http://www.gregcons.com/kateblog/" title="Kate Gregory's blog."
    >Kate Gregory</a
  >. After reading it, I tried to apply the contents to what I do in C++, first
  and foremost at my private project,
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr"
    title="GitHub page for the Litr project."
    >Litr, a task runner</a
  >. It really helped me feel more confident in the C++ code I write by removing
  code smells and hardening my application. Not that it's perfect &mdash; far
  from it &mdash; but so much better than at the end of <time>2021</time>.
</p>

<h3>Fun with game development</h3>
<p>
  Even though I always toyed around a bit with different game engines like
  <a href="https://unity.com" title="Website for Unity 3D.">Unity</a> or
  <a
    href="https://godotengine.org"
    title="Website for the Open Source game engine Godot."
    >Godot</a
  >, I never really made the effort to properly learn one. In <time>2022</time>,
  I wanted to <strong>pick one and learn it</strong>, making a small game.
  <strong>I didn't</strong>. I kept toying around, but with more engines.
  Furthermore, I wrote a little prototype in Unity and one in Godot; I went
  through some tutorials for
  <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/" title="Website of Unreal Engine."
    >Unreal Engine</a
  >
  and some for
  <a href="https://www.cryengine.com" title="Website for CryEngine."
    >CryEngine</a
  >; never really committing to one, thinking that there could be another one
  better suited for me to learn.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    <strong>It is a trap</strong> &mdash; a deep one. I went through videos,
    blogs, and books, too many to name them here*, any learning material, even
    building my own small engine supporting 2D and 3D in C++. It was an
    enlightening experience; I learned a lot but never really got closer to my
    goal of actually making a small game.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      *Special shout-out to
      <a
        href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com"
        title="Website about the book."
        >Game Programming Patterns by Bob Nystrom</a
      >.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>But it was fun</strong>, and that's something. Nevertheless, I want to
  learn <strong>one engine and make a game</strong>, so I started to focus on
  Unreal Engine. Different reasons exist, two of them being that I want to do
  more C++ and another being that it seems like a good choice to push my 3D
  learning.
</p>

<h3>A growing bookshelf</h3>
<p>
  I did always read a lot; for years, twice a day, five days a week, at least.
  But since we moved to Sweden, this dropped hard, and, even though I was still
  reading, I struggled to give myself time to read for no apparent reason. Until
  <strong>my wife had a simple idea</strong>. Every Wednesday night, after our
  child is in bed, we read at least one chapter of something. It did not take
  long for this idea to make us both read regularly again, not only on
  Wednesdays.
</p>
<p>
  I've read quite a few technical books, about C++,
  <a
    href="https://www.lua.org/pil/"
    title="Main website about the book &#34;Programming in Lua&#34;."
    >Lua</a
  >, game design, and more; finally managed to continue The Wheel of Time series
  by Robert Jordan, finishing book 9; read Project Hail Mary by
  <a href="https://andyweirauthor.com" title="Website about the author."
    >Andy Weir</a
  >; am currently at book 3 of The Expanse by
  <a
    href="https://www.jamessacorey.com"
    title="Website about the author, that is actually two people."
    >James S. A. Corey</a
  >; and a lot more books I will skip here to not make this a book report.
</p>

<h3>What I played most</h3>
<p>
  I love video games, and I played a bunch in <time>2022</time>. Here are my
  personal <strong>top five</strong> <time datetime="2022">this year</time>:
</p>
<h4>1. Cyberpunk 2077</h4>
<p>
  I played
  <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/" title="Official Cyberpunk 2077 website."
    >Cyberpunk 2077</a
  >
  on release in <time>2020</time> on my PS4, and it was rough. Nevertheless, I
  loved the game, the story, the characters, and the music. I played it again
  when I had my PS5 in <time>2021</time> &mdash; new life path, new choices. But
  in <time>2022</time>, I went overboard and made it
  <strong>my most-played game of the year</strong>. Besides getting the platinum
  trophy, I wanted to explore more of the world, the lore, see all the endings,
  etc. &mdash; and I can barely wait to play the DLC <em>"Phantom Liberty"</em>.
</p>
<h4>2. Horizon: Forbidden West</h4>
<p>
  Horizon: Zero Dawn was my absolute favorite game in <time>2017</time>, and I
  was more than anticipating the release of
  <a
    href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/games"
    title="Games page of Guerrilla Games."
    >Horizon: Forbidden West</a
  >
  in <time>2022</time>. It delivered, being my personal
  <strong>game of the year</strong> <time>2022</time>. It does look gorgeous,
  with unmatched facial animations, an intriguing story, the world, the score,
  and the overall polish of the experience.
</p>
<p>
  I can highly recommend the
  <abbr title="Game Developers Conference">GDC</abbr> talks from Guerrilla Games
  about Horizon, my favorite being
  <a
    href="https://youtu.be/KRJkBxKv1VM"
    title="YouTube video about the development of tools for Horizon."
    >Creating a Tools Pipeline for Horizon: Zero Dawn</a
  >, in awe of their craftsmanship.
</p>
<h4>3. God of War Ragnar&ouml;k</h4>
<p>
  God of War (<time>2018</time>) is grand, and finally playing the continuation,
  <a
    href="https://www.playstation.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/"
    title="Official PlayStation website for God of War Ragnar&ouml;k."
    >God of War Ragnar&ouml;k</a
  >, was well worth waiting. Even though I liked the smaller, more intimate
  story of <time>2018</time> more, I annihilated the finale of the Norse saga,
  <strong>loving every bit</strong> of it.
</p>
<h4>4. Ghost of Tsushima</h4>
<p>
  Even though
  <a
    href="https://www.suckerpunch.com/category/games/ghostoftsushima/"
    title="Official Ghost of Tsushima landing-page."
    >Ghost of Tsushima</a
  >
  came out in <time>2020</time>, it took me until this year to actually play it
  &mdash; what a game. I had some reservations initially that were quickly blown
  away. A meticulously crafted open-world that hooked me with its game
  mechanics. Especially without quest markers, finding your way through the
  world based on clues in the world and the help of the guiding wind.
</p>
<h4>5. Stray</h4>
<p>
  You play a cat; you meow; you can scratch sofas and drop buckets. Don't let
  <a href="https://stray.game" title="Official website for Stray.">Stray</a>
  fool you; it has a wonderful story, but those points alone, as a cat owner, do
  it for me.
</p>

<h3>Looking back</h3>
<p>
  I don't think I could have done anything of this without the support and help
  of <strong>my incredible wife</strong>. She convinced me that the new job at
  King could be the right thing for me, and she was right. She always supported
  me on my learnings and guided me with thoughtful advice to stay on course.
</p>
<p>
  Together we visited family in Germany, traveled with our daughter, who took
  her first steps in the summer, and then we switched parental leave, so I could
  onboard our child into kindergarten &mdash; time together I do not want to
  miss. And now, during the holidays, it is just the three of us, and
  <strong>I couldn't be happier</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Onwards to <time>2023</time></h3>
<p>No predictions, just goals for the new year that I hope to achieve.</p>
<h4>1. Having fun</h4>
<p>
  The most important one, as always. Sure, sometimes things are tough and days
  can be hard, but if it's any
  <a
    href="https://sketchplanations.com/the-fun-scale"
    title="Explanation about the types of fun."
    >type of fun</a
  >, I will keep on keeping on.

<h4>2. Learning Unreal Engine</h4>
<p>
  I finally settled on one game engine, Unreal, and I want to start working on
  my first small game with the goal of actually publishing it (though that does
  not need to be in <time>2023</time>).
</p>
<h4>3. &hellip;D, and more of it</h4>
<p>
  I want to continue learning about 3D and the many things connected to it. Next
  up will be a new article in the
  <a
    href="/series/bulkhead-door-with-blender"
    title="My 3D Bulkhead door article series."
    >Bulkhead series</a
  >
  on learning rigging and animation. Here is a small teaser of what this will
  look like.

<h4>4. Litr version 1</h4>
<p>
  Using
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr"
    title="The Litr project on GitHub."
    ><abbr title="Language Independent Task Runner">Litr</abbr></a
  >
  as my go-to project for learning C++, I want to finish the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr/milestone/1"
    title="The alpha milestone of Litr on GitHub."
    >alpha</a
  >
  and finally get
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr/milestone/2"
    title="The version 1 milestone of Litr on GitHub."
    >version 1</a
  >
  out.
</p>
<h4>5. Blogging</h4>
<p>
  Continuing to blog, I want to keep the
  <em>"publish at least once a month"</em> routine. I already planned a couple
  of articles, like a 6-part series about Lua, extending
  <a
    href="/blog/goodbye-snake-i-go-to-the-moon"
    title="Article about Lua as my go-to alternative to Python."
    >my first Lua article</a
  >.
</p>
<h4>6. Dead Space remake</h4>
<p>
  I'm looking forward to the
  <a
    href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dead-space"
    title="Official website about the Dead Space remake."
    >Dead Space remake</a
  >; the original is still one of my favorite horror games, and I hope the
  remake can spark that anew.
</p>
<h4>7. Surprising myself</h4>
<p>
  At last, I will see what <time>2023</time> brings. Maybe I will change goals;
  maybe I will find something new. I do not know. Whatever will happen &mdash;
  family, job, hobbies &mdash; I hope for good, fun, intense, happy, intriguing,
  exciting, positive, exceptional, hard, marvelous, surprising, &hellip; moments
  in <time>2023</time>.
</p>
<p>Until then 👋🏻</p>
