<h3>What content can be read?</h3>
<p>
  Development-related articles and projects, 3D and art, games, keyboards, or
  whatever I try out next. This is going to be a
  <strong>mix of topics</strong>, mainly as a knowledge base for myself.
  Everything from small things I learned, C++, web tech, projects I am working
  on, random ideas, tutorials, hobbies &mdash; you name it.
</p>
<h3>What fancy tech do I use?</h3>
<p>
  Initially, I only used <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>. That was it.
  Not because I did not like static site generators or the next best web
  framework, but rather because the scope of this website
  <strong>was</strong> tiny. Now that the page is growing, with more posts and
  pages, syntax highlighting for code snippets, embedded videos, and more, I
  needed a way to easier manage it.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to go with
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" title="Eleventy homepage">11ty</a> after
  searching for a solution that wouldn't lock me into a specific technology
  stack. It seemed effortless to use, extensible, and came with all I needed out
  of the box. Specifically for me, this is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for <abbr>HTML</abbr> and Markdown,</li>
  <li>Templating,</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting for code blocks, and</li>
  <li>Atom feed support.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Nevertheless, you can still right-click anywhere to
  <em>"view page source"</em> and actually read it; look at the
  <a
    href="/styles/main.css"
    title="CSS file of this whole website."
    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noreferrer"
    >main.css</a
  >
  and read through that; it's uncompressed and not that long; or dive even
  deeper and take a look at the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/MartinHelmut/martin-fieber.de"
    title="View the sources of this website on Github"
    >code of this website on GitHub</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  You will also find a bit of JavaScript for the privacy-friendly analytics. You
  can read more about it under my
  <a
    href="/privacy-policy/#analytics"
    title="All about privacy here on the website"
    >privacy notice page</a
  >
  or even take a look at the
  <a
    href="https://plausible.io/martin-fieber.de"
    title="Public dashboard of all the analytics data collected"
    >public dashboard of this website</a
  >. <strong>The best thing about this</strong> is that there are no cookies or
  pop-up banners.
</p>
<h3>Website style guide</h3>
<p>
  To have a better overview of all the defined components and styles in one
  place, I created a
  <a
    href="/blog/style-guide"
    title="Style guide of this website showing all components and styles used."
    >website style guide page</a
  >, showcasing all the available components, how they are defined, and how to
  use them.
</p>
<h3>OpenSource software used</h3>
