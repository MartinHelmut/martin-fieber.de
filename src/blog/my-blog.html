          <h3>What content can be read?</h3>
          <p>
            Development related articles and projects, 3D and art, games,
            keyboards, or whatever I try out next. This is going to be a
            <strong>mix of topics</strong>, mainly as a knowledge base for
            myself. So everything from small things I learned, C++, web tech,
            projects I am working on, ideas, tutorials, hobbies, you name it.
          </p>
          <h3>What fancy tech do I use?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. That's it. Not
            because I do not like static site generators or the next good web
            framework, but rather because the scope of this website is tiny.
            It's a landing page with an intro and some projects, and a blog with
            n-entries, some pictures, that is it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can right-click anywhere to "view page sources" and actually
            read it. Or look at the
            <a
              href="/style.css"
              title="CSS file of this whole website."
              target="_blank"
              rel="nofollow noreferrer"
              >style.css</a
            >
            and read through that, it's not that long. Though, you will find a
            little bit of JavaScript for the privacy-friendly analytics. You can
            read more about it under my
            <a
              href="/privacy-policy#analytics"
              title="All about privacy here on the website"
              >privacy notice page</a
            >
            or even have a look at the
            <a
              href="https://plausible.io/martin-fieber.de"
              title="Public dashboard of all the analytics data collected"
              >public dashboard of this website</a
            >. <strong>The best thing with this:</strong> there are no cookies
            or pop-up banners.
