            I thought I should take on a <em>"little"</em> project going
            <strong

            >. Creating the high- and low-poly mesh, UV unwrapping, baking,
            texturing, rigging, animating and finally having it presentable in a
            game engine like Unity. I see now that calling this
            <em>"little"</em> was blind optimism on my end. After spending hours
            over hours on my model I just finished baking the high-poly mesh
            onto the low-poly mesh, feeling rather intimidated by the next big
            step texturing. But, I still think there is a lot to tell so this

            I thought I could pick something out of the Alien universe I would
            like to recreate. I also wanted to learn rigging and animating,
            therefore whatever I pick had to have moving parts. My first thought
            was that I will recreate the iconic Alien spaceship the

            person, ... &#8212; even I knew this is a bit much for me. It needs
            to be something smaller, and after some research I came across the
            original drawing of a

            His drawing differs from what was used in the movie as the movie
            does not have the red warn lights around the door, as well as some
            differences at the side barrier doors. What I wanted was to recreate
            his drawing as good as I could, as close as possible, and this is
            what I set out to do.
          </p>
          <h3>Creating the mesh</h3>
          <p>
            Starting to work on the high-poly mesh I thought this step should
            not take too long. Ohh was I wrong. I started over twice, third time
            is the charm they say. It was, even though it still took me hours
            and
            <strong
              >I would do so many things differently if I would do it all over
              again</strong
            >, but this is what learning feels like, and I will call it a nice
            feeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hours I got the high-poly mesh as ready as I wanted it to be.
            Here a look at the frame with retracted inner side barrier doors and
            a view of the closed bulkhead door, both with temporarily applied
            materials for better visibility.

            As I was using the AddOns
            <a

            with a non-destructive boolean workflow, making the creation of the
            low-poly mesh easier by just removing some boolean cuts. Here a
            front view of the low-poly mesh.

          </figure>
          <p>
            I really liked using those AddOns, even though I want to try a
            different workflow with e.g.
            <a
              href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/"
              title="Homepage of the Blender AddOn MESHmachine."
              >MESHmachine</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://machin3.io/MACHIN3tools/"
              title="Homepage of the MACHIN3tools Blender AddOn."
              >MACHIN3tools</a
            >, or additive to the boolean workflow to touch up parts of the mesh
            after applying modifiers to get even better results. For now though
            I wanted to restrain myself from using even more tools.

          <h3>UV unwrapping</h3>
          <p>
            Doing the UV unwrapping turned out to be
            <strong>harder than expected</strong> and also
            <strong>easier than I thought</strong>, at least after I figured out
            what my issues were I had. There were two main problems I
            encountered that I'm sure I can avoid when I tackle my next project.
            The first one is that I had <em>"flipped normals"</em>.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="/images/blog/bulkhead-door-with-blender/normal-issues.png"
              alt="The outer frame of the bulkhead door in red and blue, symbolising flipped normals."

            />
            <figcaption>A lot of issues with flipped normals.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            All the red you see? Ya, not good. It's kind of an
            <em>"inside out"</em> problem, aka. a face being in the wrong
            direction. After some searching I found out I can
            <em>"recalculate outside"</em>.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="/images/blog/bulkhead-door-with-blender/menu-for-fixing-normals.png"

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Doing that for all my parts that had wrong normals I finally got
            them the way it should be, all blue.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img

            <figcaption>
              &#34;Recalculate Outside&#34; indeed fixed my flipped normals.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The second issue I had I was not able to fully fix; some vertices
            seemed <em>"misplaced"</em> when unwrapping the mesh, producing some
            very strange result in the UV map. You still see some of those
            artefacts in the final result.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Result of my UV unwrapping.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            But all in all I'm quite happy with the result and decided to move
            on &#8212; <strong>for the sake of time</strong>. Besides, that it
            did not seem to make any problems the way I had it when I tested the
            asset later. To avoid this type of issue in the future I would try
            to take better care when creating the actual mesh. Looking closer at
            the topology I am producing, hoping that future Martin will figure
            that out.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this amount of stress, and the feeling I messed up everything,
            I was still able to have everything properly UV unwrapped.

          <h3>Baking in Marmoset</h3>
          <p>
            Initially when it came to baking the high-poly mesh onto the
            low-poly mesh I thought I will use Blender as well. Even though I
            still plan on learning this in Blender, I decided to go with
            <a href="https://marmoset.co" title="Website of Marmoset"
              >Marmoset Toolbag 4</a
            >. In hindsight, I would call this
            <em>"a whole new beast to tackle"</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why <strong>Marmoset</strong> and not <strong>Blender</strong> or
            <a
              href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html"
              title="Adobe website with more information to Substance Painter."
              >Adobe Substance Painter</a
            >? I made the decision as I saw it used not only in a bunch of
            tutorials, but also due to the support for
            <a
              href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag/texturing/"
              title="Information about texturing with Marmoset Toolbag 4."
              >Texturing</a
            >, including the usage of
            <a
              href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag/library/"
              title="Overview of the material library of Marmoset Toolbag 4."
              >smart materials</a
            >. It also made the impression of being rather intuitive to use (I
            was not too wrong with this, I actually was able to figure out a lot
            of things just on my own). What caught me as well was the pricing,
            it gives the option to either pay per month as subscription or, my
            favourite, make <strong>a one time payment</strong> and you own the
            program. This was <b class="emphasize">the</b> reason for me to not
            go with Adobe Substance Painter as I dislike the subscription only
            way Adobe goes with all there products now-days. Not using Blender
            was just due to reading about poor support for baking and texturing
            (so far, apparently there is
            <a
              href="https://code.blender.org/2022/02/layered-textures-design/"
              title="Blog post about the work being done in Blender for better texturing support."
              >work being done</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting to the actual baking process this was super convenient. This
            was thanks to the naming convention for meshes, having the high-poly
            mesh named with <code>_high</code>, and <code>_low</code> for the
            low-poly mesh, exported in the same way.

            This enabled me to <em>"just hit import"</em> in Marmoset and get a
            proper setup bake project.

            I was able to bake the project and get all the maps I needed (here

            As mentioned, this is not the end of my journey creating the
            Bulkhead door. Next up will be

            the door in Blender. And finally
            <strong>having it all in Unity</strong> with some nice lighting as a
            proper showcase. I started getting my feet wet texturing the door in
            Marmoset, nothing fancy yet; here a little sneak peek of my first
            experiments.

            My goal is to get a <strong>realistic door</strong> with materials
            <strong>inspired by the movie</strong>, though I think this will
            still be a long way.

            That will continue next month with part 2 of this
            <em>"little"</em>
            project 👋🏻.
