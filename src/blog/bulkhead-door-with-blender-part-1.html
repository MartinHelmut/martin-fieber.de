<h3>Learning more 3D modelling</h3>

  To deepen my
  <a
    href="/blog/i-started-learning-3d"
    title="The start of my journey learning 3D with Blender"
    >3D journey I started</a
  >, I thought I should take on a <em>"little"</em> project going
  <strong>from Blenders default cube to a finished and game ready asset</strong
  >. Creating the high- and low-poly mesh, <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapping, baking,
  texturing, rigging, animating and finally having it presentable in a game
  engine. I see now that calling this little was blind optimism on my end.
</p>
<p>
  After spending hours over hours on my model I only finished baking the
  high-poly mesh onto the low-poly mesh, feeling rather intimidated by the next
  big step; texturing. But, I still think there is a lot to tell, so this post
  will focus on:

  I thought I could pick something out of the Alien universe I would like to
  recreate. I also wanted to learn rigging and animating, therefore whatever I
  pick had to have moving parts. My first thought was that I will recreate the
  iconic Alien spaceship, the

  In my head already painting how I recreate the spaceship in the smallest
  detail, moving parts, lights, walking the interior in first person, &hellip;
  &#8212; even I knew this will be too much for me. It needs to be something
  smaller, and after some research I came across the original drawing of a

  His drawing differs from what was used in the movie as the movie does not have
  the red warn lights around the door, as well as some differences at the side
  barrier doors, namely form and color. What I wanted was to recreate his
  drawing as good as I could, as close as possible, and this is what I set out
  to do.
</p>
<h3>Creating the mesh</h3>
<p>
  Starting to work on the high-poly mesh, I thought this step should not take
  too long. I was very wrong. I started over twice, third time is the charm they
  say. It was, even though it still took me hours and
  <strong
    >I would do so many things different if I would do it all over again</strong
  >, but this is what learning feels like, and I will call it a nice feeling.
</p>
<p>
  After hours I got the high-poly mesh as ready as I wanted it to be. Here a
  look at the frame with retracted inner side barrier doors and a view of the
  closed bulkhead door, both with temporarily applied materials for better
  visibility.

  with a non-destructive boolean workflow, making the creation of the low-poly
  mesh easier by removing some boolean cuts.

<p>
  I really liked using those AddOns, even though I want to try a different
  workflow with e.g.
  <a
    href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/"
    title="Homepage of the Blender AddOn MESHmachine."
    >MESHmachine</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://machin3.io/MACHIN3tools/"
    title="Homepage of the MACHIN3tools Blender AddOn."
    >MACHIN3tools</a
  >, or additive to the boolean workflow to touch up parts of the mesh after
  applying modifiers to get even better results. For now though I wanted to
  restrain myself from using too many tools.

<h3><abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapping</h3>
<p>
  The <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapping turned out to be
  <strong>harder than expected</strong>. It got easier, at least after I figured
  out what my issues were I had on my first tries. There were two main problems
  I encountered that I'm sure I can avoid when I tackle my next project. The
  first one is that I had <em>"flipped normals"</em>.
</p>
<figure>

    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>A lot of issues with flipped normals.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  All the red you see? Ya, not good. It's kind of an
  <em>"inside out"</em> problem, aka. a face being in the wrong direction. After
  some searching I found out I can use a function called
  <em>"recalculate outside"</em>.
</p>
<figure>

      type="image/webp"

<p>
  Doing that for all my parts that had wrong normals, I finally got them the way
  it should be &#8212; all blue.

</figure>
<p>
  The second issue I had I was not able to fully fix; some vertices seemed
  <em>"misplaced"</em> when unwrapping the mesh, producing some strange result
  in the <abbr>UV</abbr> map. You still see some of those artefacts in the final
  result.
</p>

  <figcaption>Result of my <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapping.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  All in all I'm still quite happy with the result and decided to move on
  &#8212; <strong>for the sake of time</strong>. Besides that it did not seem to
  make any problems the way I had it when I tested the asset later. To avoid
  this type of issue in the future I would try to take better care when working
  on a mesh. Having a better look at the topology I'm creating, hoping that
  future Martin will figure that out.
</p>
<p>
  With this amount of stress, and the feeling I messed up everything, I was
  still able to have everything properly <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapped.

<h3>Baking in Marmoset</h3>
<p>
  Initially, when it came to baking the high-poly mesh onto the low-poly mesh I
  thought I will use Blender. Even though I still plan on learning this in
  Blender, I decided to go with
  <a href="https://marmoset.co" title="Website of Marmoset"
    >Marmoset Toolbag 4</a
  >. In hindsight, I would call this <em>"a whole new beast to tackle"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Why <strong>Marmoset</strong> and not <strong>Blender</strong> or
  <a
    href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html"
    title="Adobe website with more information to Substance Painter."
    >Adobe Substance Painter</a
  >? I made the decision as I saw it used not only in a bunch of tutorials, but
  also due to the support for
  <a
    href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag/texturing/"
    title="Information about texturing with Marmoset Toolbag 4."
    >Texturing</a
  >, including the usage of
  <a
    href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag/library/"
    title="Overview of the material library of Marmoset Toolbag 4."
    >smart materials</a
  >. It also made the impression of being rather intuitive to use (I was not
  wrong, I actually was able to figure out a lot of things on my own). What got
  me as well was the pricing, it gives the option to either pay per month as
  subscription or, my favourite, make <strong>a one time payment</strong> and
  you own the program. This was <b class="emphasize">the</b> reason for me to
  not use Adobe Substance Painter, as I dislike the subscription-only way Adobe
  goes with all products now-days. Not using Blender was due to reading about
  poor support for baking and texturing (so far, apparently there is
  <a
    href="https://code.blender.org/2022/02/layered-textures-design/"
    title="Blog post about the work being done in Blender for better texturing support."
    >work being done</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  Getting to the actual baking process &#8212; a particularly convenient one
  thanks to the naming convention for meshes. Having the high-poly mesh named
  with <code>_high</code>, and <code>_low</code> for the low-poly mesh, exported
  in the same way.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Texturing with Marmoset,</li>
  <li>Rigging, and</li>
  <li>Animating</li>
</ul>
<p>
  the door in Blender. And finally
  <strong>having it all in inside a game engine</strong> of my choice, with some
  nice lighting to showcase the project. Here a little sneak peek of my first
  texturing experiments in Marmoset, nothing fancy, yet.
