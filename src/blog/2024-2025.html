<h3>Looking back at 2024</h3>
<p>
  A strange year behind me, certainly. On the one hand &mdash; now in our new
  little home in Småland, Sweden &mdash; it was rather calm for the family. We
  made the house an actual home, found our first friends in the neighbourhood,
  explored the area, and generally lived our lives.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    On the other hand, it was overly exciting on every other front. My wife
    started her own business, a big step to a more fulfilling life for her; I
    worked and learned quite a lot, also the reason I slowed down publishing on
    my blog*; and in bigger news, <strong>we'll already leave</strong> our
    beloved little space we made our home, as well as Sweden, in
    <time>2025</time>.
    <a href="#new-job-new-country">But more on that later</a>.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      * Even thought I planned, I didn't publish much. Something I want to
      correct in <time>2025</time>.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h3>Our little home</h3>
<p>
  As mentioned, since the beginning of the year we live in Bruzaholm, Sweden. We
  renovated, painted, decorated — we made it our cosy little place. The year
  began with <strong>minus 20 degree Celsius</strong> and lots of snow. Sounds
  cold, but it was spectacular.
</p>
<p>
  In the summer we got a new member into our family, our dog Nori. She is a
  German Shepard mix that gets lovingly along with our daughter &mdash; not only
  that, even with the cats &mdash; we really love her.

<h3>As always, more C++</h3>
<p>
  Like the last years I continued learning more C++, through work and, even
  more, privately. It was not an explicit goal for <time>2024</time>, though it
  took a major part of my free time I had for my studies. Not because I had to,
  but because I wanted to.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to learn more complicated topics, tried to close darker corners of my
  understanding of the language and ecosystem. What I gained is for sure a
  better view, especially on how big this landscape is, and that there'll be so
  much more to learn.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    For those learnings, I originally wanted to bring
    <a
      href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr"
      title="The Litr ptoject GitHub page."
      >Litr</a
    >
    to version 1. I was so sure. Yet, it did not happen. I started a new project
    &mdash; yeah I know, as I've not had enough &mdash; a
    <strong>bigger and more ambitious</strong> one, that actually pushed me out
    of my comfort zone and helped more than I initially anticipated*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* I'll write a separate article about this in the near future.</p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h3>Blender is love, Blender is life</h3>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Where C++ is learning for a more fulfilling professional life*, Blender is
    pure hobby and joy. <strong>No deadlines, no requirements</strong>; whatever
    I want. I love it. Naturally, I want to get better with the tools I use, so
    I tried more varied 3D modelling techniques. I really love learning.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Not a sentence anyone would ever expect to hear.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  I finally started to learn subdivision modelling, a long and tricky road, yet
  a fun one; continued to challenge myself almost every week, to create
  something, anything, even if not perfect; and started working more with
  procedural texturing and on my own small tools to help me in that process.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    Some of the Blender projects I worked on in <time>2024</time>. None of them
    finished.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Anyway, opening Blender for me feels like getting a fresh piece of paper as a
  kid. The same feeling of endless possibilities to create anything I have in
  mind. Who cares about the outcome if the process is fun.
</p>

<h3>Writing, writing, writing</h3>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Even though I did not publish a lot, say through my blog, I wrote a lot.
    Some for my blog, yes, but mainly for
    <strong>my first fiction book</strong> I want to publish some day*. As
    mentioned in
    <a
      href="/blog/2023-2024#alsafi"
      title="My plan I have with my world called Alsafi."
      >my last year's retrospective</a
    >, I'm working on a world called
    <a
      href="/blog/to-create-a-world-from-scratch"
      title="Article I wrote about me creating Alsafi."
      >Alsafi</a
    >. I love the world-building part, and even more writing a book set in that
    world, the first Alsafi-story.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* <em>"Some day"</em> is doing some heavy lifting here.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  So it's all about rewriting. And more writing. And rewriting. And more
  writing, and &hellip; you get the gist. I'm going crazy over the smallest
  details, question anything, rearrange everything. I mainly try to cut things
  down currently, remove fluff, be consistent. All very hard problems for me,
  who never wrote a book. But fun. And I cannot wait to someday have the proper
  book in my hands, that I wrote.
</p>

<h3>Odin!</h3>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    What I did not plan at all was me starting to look at
    <strong>a new programming language</strong>. I mean, I always love learning
    a new language; through this random urge I
    <a href="/series/lua" title="A series about Lua I'm writing."
      >discovered Lua for myself</a
    >
    and will never let it go again*. But with all the things I already have
    going on, why learn another programming language?
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Lua is love, Lua is life.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  The answer is rather simple &hellip; <strong>because I wanted to</strong>, and
  it is fun. I came to look at
  <a href="https://odin-lang.org" title="Odin homepage">Odin</a>, finding out
  that the
  <a href="https://jangafx.com" title="JangaFX homepage">JangaFX suite</a> is
  written in it. Those tools are custom, highly performant, and beautiful;
  besides being the useful tools they are. Naturally, I wanted to know how they
  were build, through which I found Odin.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>And for me, Odin is exactly what it suggests, a better C*.</p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Yes, I said it. Hate me if you want, it's my opinion.</p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h3>What I played this year</h3>
<p>
  Same as always, I love video games and I've played a bunch of them. This is
  <strong>no ranking</strong>, at all, I just want to mention some of the games
  I played in <time>2024</time> that I did not play before. From new releases to
  older ones.
</p>

<h4>Pentiment</h4>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Released in <time>2022</time> I only managed to play it now &mdash; I
    shouldn't have waited so long. This 16th-century murder mystery is my
    <strong>absolute highlight of 2024</strong>, above any other game I've
    played. <em>"Why, though?"</em> asking myself. For once, the length is
    great, no too short, not too long, <em>lagom</em>*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Swedish word for <em>"just the right amount"</em>.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Visually, it was a feast. Not in a
  <em>"high fidelity something-traced 3D graphics"</em> way, but no less
  <strong>crafted with care and love</strong>, and plenty of detail. For
  example, different unique fonts representing different people and the level of
  education, taking over the role of voice-over artists. Little mistakes that
  get corrected while the text is written on screen as the character speaks,
  that was especially delightful for me. For someone who loves reading, this was
  pure joy and I did not once skip over this type of animation.
</p>
<p>
  Another great example is the marginalia (little drawings in a book's margin).
  Partially used for pure artistic reasons, ranging from pretty to quirky;
  partially to show current characters mentioned in a scene; or to give further
  explanation to, e.g. a historical place.
</p>
<p>
  Besides that, the whole game made me <strong>think about my life</strong>, a
  lot. My past decisions, the people I influenced knowing or unknowingly, where
  I want to go and how, and what will be left of me when I'm not around any
  more. How will I be remembered by my daughter, family, friends?
</p>
<p>
  I know those are indeed typical thoughts a person might have &mdash; not the
  first time I had them too &mdash; but somehow Pentiment did it in a very
  touching way that got close to me.
</p>
<p>
  That game, really stuck. It gave me the feeling of one of those
  <em>"Game books"</em>
  (e.g. Choose Your Own Adventure&reg; book series), and I will never ever play
  Pentiment again. The one path I took feels almost precious, something I want
  to preserve the memory of, not water it down with another play-through and
  different choices. I for myself will just keep the memory of what I
  experienced the way I did &mdash; from a beautiful game.
</p>

<h4>Harold Halibut</h4>
<p>
  Quirky, intriguing, lovely; that's what Harold Halibut is for me. I decided to
  play it on a hunch, purely based on the visuals. The game was made with
  stop-motion: clay, wood, textiles, metals. The heads of the characters of that
  world, not bigger than walnuts.
</p>
<p>
  It tells a lovely story of the lab assistant Harold, on a spaceship crashed
  into the ocean of a far away planet. But the setting is much more grounded
  than it first seems, with a lovely story, and enough to explore that I spend
  more time in that world I ever imagined I would.
</p>

<h4>Indika</h4>
<p>
  What a strange but captivating game about a nun and her connection to the
  devil. Or rather, her battling her own demons, and how others see her. Or her
  way of finding herself and what she really believes in? Or is it rather about
  the conflict between the church and her own and other peoples view of the
  world? All of it? None?
</p>
<p>
  I'm not absolutely sure to be honest. Whatever it was, including the
  occasional feeling of <strong>being in a fever dream</strong>, it intrigued me
  with its art- and <em>"differentness"</em>.
</p>

<h4>Star Wars Outlaws</h4>
<p>
  For years, I did not play any Ubisoft game &mdash; feelings of fatigue on the
  always same and reappearing formula on how they approach any open world. On
  top, I'm not big on Star Wars games, the fantasy of playing a powerful Jedi
  leaves me cold. This time though, you're not playing a Jedi or whatever mighty
  character, you're just a smuggler, doing your thing, in an as it seemed
  beautiful crafted sci-fi world.
</p>
<p>
  And it was, and I enjoyed it a lot. The world feels lived in, there was not
  too much going on all the time, not 100 icons with things I
  <em>"need to do"</em>, making it overall feel less overwhelming to me. And
  yet, everywhere something was happening, in the details. People living their
  lives, guards scheming, technicians repairing ships &mdash; a world to immerse
  myself in.
</p>
<p>
  The only thing I did not like was the mini-game <em>Sabacc</em>, where I only
  did what I really had to for story purposes. Otherwise, I did not touch it
  with a ten-meter pole. That was really no <em>Gwent</em>.
</p>

<h4>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</h4>
<p>
  I loved the first, and I did like the second game. As I was really looking
  forward to this game, with absolute amazing visuals, yet, it did fell short
  for me on multiple fronts.
</p>
<p>
  As visually impressive as it was, this could also have been a 2-hour movie and
  I would have liked it just as much. The combat was simpler compared to the
  first game, and the puzzles were pretty straight forward. Not much else
  happened besides traversing the linear path of the environment.
</p>
<p>
  I also think the first game would not have needed a second. It was a nice
  stand-alone story with a proper ending, while the story of the second game did
  not reach the heights of the first at all. Nevertheless, I have to say Melina
  Juergens performance as Senua was again magnificent and really stood out to
  me.
</p>

<h4>Baldur's Gate 3</h4>
<p>
  I don't think I have much to add to this truly splendid game, a game that gave
  me endless possibilities for role-playing and will give me even more for years
  to come.
</p>
<p>
  I poured more hours into this game in <time>2024</time> than I did into any
  other game, maybe even combined. And I still have so much to explore, ideas
  for new characters, alternate paths I want to take, and so on. Even only
  thinking about it writing this, <strong>I want to play again</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Astro Bot</h4>
<p>
  A game in the truest sense of the word &mdash; what an amazing ride. Sometimes
  a classic platformer is the best, and Astro Bot was pure, fun, platforming. It
  combined high fidelity visuals, joyful game mechanics, and a colourful world
  with some of the most difficult levels I ever played.
</p>
<p>
  Mastering those difficult levels felt truly rewarding, other level were just
  plain fun. Even the end-credits: chefs kiss, would blast again. I know I will
  get Astro Bot out whenever I need a good old round of video gaming.
</p>

<h4>Nobody Wants to die</h4>
<p>
  A noir murder thriller set in a futuristic environment &mdash; no need to
  convince me more. It was great. Not a massive game that will eat all my time,
  and I appreciate this very much, it was perfect. A great story, told with the
  right pacing, and a superb atmosphere.
</p>

<h4>Still wakes the deep</h4>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Being on an oil rig already feels tense to me. But having that rig overrun
    by monsters, falling apart, while needing to escape with no way to fight
    back &hellip; Still wakes the deep was a really tense game that gave me
    partial Alien: Isolation vibes*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* And I really really love Alien: Isolation.</p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h4>Demon's Souls Remake</h4>
<p>
  I'm late to the party, I know. I owned the Demon's Souls remake since buying
  the PlayStation 5 at release and never played it, until now, somewhat
  intimated by the difficulty, as I'm not really a souls or souls-like player.
  Thanks to the warm recommendation of a friend, I gave it a shot.
</p>
<p>
  And after I really tried and stuck with it, I need to say it is an amazing
  game. I love it, and it made me start playing other souls-like games now too.
  Like an entry drug, Demon's Souls did its part.
</p>

<h3>My past goals</h3>
<p>
  Looking back at
  <a
    href="/blog/2023-2024"
    title="My last years retrospective article covering what happened in 2023."
    >last years goals</a
  >, I'm surprised of how much of them I actually worked on. There is only one I
  did not even consider, building
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr"
    title="The Litr ptoject GitHub page."
    >Litr</a
  >
  version 1. I wanted to use Litr to deepen my C++ knowledge and instead worked
  on a much bigger C++ project. Thankfully Litr in its current state is already
  all I need, so that was not too bad.
</p>
<p>
  On anything else I did actually work on; even more. Writing and expanding the
  world of Alsafi, learning more 3D modelling, adding new blog posts (even if
  fewer than I planned), and I had fun. I also started to work more with Godot
  and am really liking it. Besides that I worked a lot more with C++ and Lua.
</p>

<h3>Onwards to <time>2025</time></h3>
<p>
  No year goes by without me settings some new goals for myself. So here I go
  &hellip;
</p>

<h4>1. Having fun</h4>
<p>
  Again? Yes, yes again. Fun is what this all should be. I love learning, I have
  fun exploring new things, and even if some of those things can be stressful,
  <strong>Fun</strong> should be the main focus.
</p>

<h4>2. Alsafi</h4>
<p>
  This will be a goal for years to come. What I started a while ago I want to
  constantly expand, this world, and finally publish my first book set in it. I
  also want a world wiki where I can publish and browse all the available
  information. The wiki is planned to be written as if it is in-universe,
  including images, maps, videos, etc. and be available at
  <a href="https://alsafi.world" title="Home of Alsafi">alsafi.world</a>
</p>

<h4>3. Keep on keeping on 3D</h4>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    I love Blender, I even donate monthly. And I want to keep on keeping on
    working with 3D modelling. I'm learning more and more, and I have many areas
    that need further developing to be at a point where I feel happy with it. I
    also started to explore new ways for texturing, like hand painted textures
    inspired by the great
    <a
      href="https://technouveau.net"
      title="Technouveau website with a bunch of amazing projects."
      >technouveau</a
    >, as well as procedural texturing through a node-based tool I'm working on
    to replace Substance Designer with*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* For my own use cases, not universally.</p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h4>4. Blogging</h4>
<p>
  I want this to be a better defined goal. Last year I thought I can just
  <em>"publish when things are ready"</em>, but I'm a perfectionist, therefore I
  published only little. I will go back to a past goal, to publish at least once
  per month. With this <em>"stricter"</em> goal, I hope I can push myself to
  blog more.
</p>

<h4 id="new-job-new-country">5. New job, new country</h4>
<p>
  No matter what I want to work on or have planned, I need to be gentle with
  myself. <time>2025</time> will be full of big changes for me and my family: I
  start a new job for which we will move to Finland, my wife will expand her
  business, a new language (Finnish) to learn, a new day care for my child.
  That's only what we know so far. So yeah, I should be thoughtful to myself.
</p>

<h3>Wrap it up, please!</h3>
<p>
  And with this, another year is gone. Shitty things happen in the world I did
  not mention here, because this is my happy place. Sadly, the world gets less
  of a happy place for many, year after year. More war, the rich getting richer,
  humans and human rights treated like garbage, the environment burned, the
  internet salted, AI slop everywhere &hellip;
</p>
<p>
  I don't need to write all that down here, because many of those events will be
  part of the recorded history. I just hope history will be written by better
  people. No matter the prospect, I still believe that we all can be
  collectively better, I just have to.
</p>
<p>
  And with that I'll end this article simple with:
  <strong
    >fuck Nazis, trans rights are human rights, black lives matter, eat the
    rich, delete generative AI</strong
  >.
</p>

<p>Until then 👋🏻</p>
