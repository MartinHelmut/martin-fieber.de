<h3 id="prolog">Prolog</h3>
<p>
  In my <strong>never-ending quest to master CMake</strong>, I'm coming across
  more and more handy tools for project setup and management. Trying to maintain
  a good starter template for my projects and having developed a few opinions on
  how I want my projects to work, I finally looked at <em>"CMake Presets"</em> I
  had already heard much about.
</p>
<p>
  One of those opinions is that I want CMake to do as much as possible without
  relying on other tools to minimize what is needed for a project setup. If I
  have a setting that CMake already supports through an option, I define it,
  reducing what is needed for execution further.
</p>
<p>
  With this in mind, I always thought I wouldn't really need CMake presets, but
  it turned out some settings I always configure were missing.
</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>
  What will I cover in this article? It won't be every setting with every
  property, and in general, the
  <a
    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html"
    title="CMake documentation about all preset properties."
    >official CMake documentation about presets</a
  >
  is quite extensive. If this is what you're looking for, you can follow the
  link.
</p>
<p>
  Even though <strong>the official docs are great</strong>, I prefer a different
  format when it comes to presentation and personal taste, and that's why this
  article exists.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, some of the settings that can be configured with presets I would
  rather see directly in a CMake file. This will also be the general approach,
  <strong>what can live in a CMake file will</strong>, everything else goes to a
  preset.

<h3 id="what-are-cmake-presets">What are CMake Presets?</h3>
<p>
  With time and more knowledge about CMake, certain project settings appear
  again and again. For me, I found a set of settings I tend to use in every
  project. I always set up Ninja on Windows and Linux, Xcode on macOS, define
  the same build directories, or even run the same CTest commands.
</p>
<p>
  Presets enable defining exactly those standard or repeated project settings
  for CMake and give the option to easily override them per project if needed
  &mdash; things like the build directory, generator, or target architecture.
</p>
<p>
  I can then take this file, throw it in a CMake project, and be
  <strong>ready to go</strong>. Especially considering tooling support, where
  many IDEs like CLion detect those presets and automatically set up a project.
</p>

<h3 id="create-a-preset">Create a preset</h3>
<p>
  A preset is, at its core, a <code>CMakePresets.json</code> in the root of the
  project. It gets <strong>checked into source control</strong> and defines
  project-wide settings. The minimum requirement to be a valid preset file is
  the <code>version</code> field that defines the version of the used JSON
  schema.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-json hljs">{
  "version": 6
}</code></pre>
  <figcaption><code>CMakePresets.json</code> with schema version 6.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Version 6 is not the latest, that be version 8. I picked version 6 as it is
  the
  <a
    href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/cmake-presets.html"
    title="CLion overview of how CMake presets are supported."
    >latest CLion supported version of CMake presets</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  One benefit of using version 8 is the support of the
  <code>$schema</code> field, which defines a URL to the JSON schema to validate
  the file contents against.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-json hljs">{
  "version": 8,
  "$schema": "https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/_downloads/3e2d73bff478d88a7de0de736ba5e361/schema.json"
}</code></pre>

    title="CMake documentation about the usage of the JSON schema."
    >JSON schema is from the official CMake documentation</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing I see often used in projects is the
  <code>cmakeMinimumRequired</code> property, though I'd rather define this
  version through CMake itself, e.g., in the root CMake file of the project.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-cmake hljs"># CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)</code></pre>
</figure>

<h3 id="basic-configuration">Basic configuration</h3>
<p>
  The base of most CMake presets is the
  <a
    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#configure-preset"
    title="CMake documentation about configure presets."
    ><code>configurePresets</code> property</a
  >, which defines configurations that are applied to the
  <strong>configuration phase</strong>, like defining the build directory or the
  used generator.
</p>
<p>
  The minimum required setting is a <strong>name for the preset</strong>, but a
  <strong>display name is recommended</strong> to be shown when interacting with
  the preset through a <abbr>GUI</abbr> or the CMake <abbr>CLI</abbr>,
  increasing usability.

    This will execute CMake's configuration step with the selected preset.

</figure>

<h3 id="user-presets">User presets</h3>
<p>
  Working on a project with CMake presets, there can always be the case where a
  user needs or wants to <strong>define their own presets</strong> for any
  reason. This can be done through the <code>CMakeUserPresets.json</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  This file has the same structure as the <code>CMakePresets.json</code> to
  override or extend any options and should always be
  <strong>excluded from any source control</strong> &mdash; I usually add this
  to my global <code>.gitignore</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  For example, defining a release build with debug information as a user preset.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-json hljs">{
  "version": 6,
  "configurePresets": [

<h3 id="conditional-configuration">Conditional configuration</h3>
<aside class="callout">

  <p>Conditions were added to CMake in version 3.21.</p>
</aside>
<p>
  A very handy feature, especially when it comes to multi-platform
  configurations, are
  <a
    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#condition"
    title="Official CMake documentation about preset conditions."
    >conditional configurations</a
  >. With this, it is possible to define <strong>when</strong> a preset is
  available, for example, to configure Xcode as generator only on macOS.
</p>

  The condition reads as: compare two values (<code>equals</code>), the
  left-hand string (<code>lhs</code>) is the variable
  <code>hostSystemName</code>, the right-hand string (<code>rhs</code>) is
  <em>"Darwin"</em> (aka. macOS).
</p>
<p>
  There are many different options for conditionals; different types, multiple
  conditions to match any or all of; best taken from the

    href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#condition"

</p>

<h3 id="inherit-settings">Inherit settings</h3>
<p>
  Any preset can inherit another to override or add to it. It is common to
  define a base preset, hide it with the <code>hidden</code> property, and
  derive specific presets from it. Another typical use case is to have a local
  and a derived continuous integration (<abbr>CI</abbr>) preset.
</p>
<p>
  With this, let's first create a common, hidden base preset using Ninja as a
  generator.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-json hljs">{
  "version": 6,
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "common",
      "hidden": true,
      "generator": "Ninja",
      "binaryDir": "build/${presetName}"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
</figure>
<p>
  The binary directory is predefined, using the variable
  <code>presetName</code> to set the directory based on the derived preset. Via
  <code>inherits</code> the base preset will be inherited by name.
</p>
<figure>
  <pre><code class="language-json hljs">{
  "version": 6,
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "common",

    },
    {
      "name": "debug",
      "displayName": "Debug",
      "inherits": "common",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug"
      }
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
</figure>

<h3 id="common-variable-setup">Common variable setup</h3>
<p>
  Even though I prefer to set as much as possible from inside a CMake file, it
  can come in very handy to define some cache variables through a preset. One of
  those is to run a project against <strong>multiple compilers</strong>, e.g.,
  for <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
  Using <a href="#inherit-settings">inheritance</a>, a
  <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr> preset can be derived from an
  already existing preset. Given the following base preset:

  With a properly defined configuration step, it is just a small jump to also
  define a

    A great advantage of using build presets is that they can predetermine what
    targets are built and when. For example, only building tests, everything for
    a debug build, or just the main target for a release, all while having a
    simple, explorable* command.
