<h3>Priorities are rescinded</h3>
<p>
  This low-fi tech in a high-tech environment, Cassette Futurism, really caught
  me, influencing me more than I realised for a long time.
  <strong>I love the style</strong>, art, movies, and games influence by it, not
  every aspect of my life is, but a few are: a lot of the media I like, my
  keyboard, even the watch I'm currently waring is a

<h3>Admiration</h3>

  all great examples for cassette futurism.

    intriguing story set between the first Alien and Aliens.
