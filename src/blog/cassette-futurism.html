<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
  Two of my favourite movies are Ridley Scotts
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)"
    title="Wikipedia page for Alien the movie"
    >Alien</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner"
    title="The Blade Runner Wikipedia page"
    >Blade Runner</a
  >. Both of them have a distinguished style in their environment, items, and
  general aesthetics, best called <dfn>cassette futurism</dfn>. A retro
  aesthetic that combines visuals from the late 1960s to early 1980s forming
  general computers, handhelds, cyber-decks or even environments and every day
  products &#8212; usually associated with low-fi tech.

<p>
  Imagine futuristic space travel, but software updates come on cassette tapes,
  locks are secured via punch card, the flight computer is analog, and if
  something is broken you can open it up and probably solder something back
  together or put tape on it for a repair.
  <strong>I love it.</strong>

  I want to give some appreciation to some movies and artists utilising cassette
  futurism one way or the other.
</p>

  <h3>Alien</h3>
  <p>
    THE Alien movie in the whole Alien franchise for me. I know how people love
    the second one,
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)"
      title="Wikipedia page for the second Alien movie, Aliens"
      >Aliens</a
    >, and I do too, but the first movie, slow paced as it is, this is where my
    heart lies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design of the interior and devices, computers or the motion sensor used
    in the movie, are good examples of cassette futurism. Low tech in a
    high-tech scenario, like space travel.

  <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
  <p>
    Same director as Alien, Blade Runner hits hard on design. A dark,
    cyberpunk'esque, cassette futurism, sci-fi, movie. Based on the
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick"
      title="Wikipedia page about the Philip"
      >Philip K. Dick</a

      title="Wikipedia page about the book"
      >Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a
    >, by the way an amazing author of science fiction literature. Seeing this
    movie sharing certain connections with Alien, some would say sharing a
    universe, it is no wonder it tickles the spot in my heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides that, the second movie,
