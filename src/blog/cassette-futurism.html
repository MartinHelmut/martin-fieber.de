<h3>Priorities are rescinded</h3>
<p>
  This low-fi tech in a high-tech environment, Cassette Futurism, really caught
  me, influencing me more than I realized for a long time.
  <strong>I love the style</strong>, art, movies, and games influenced by it;
  not every aspect of my life is, but a few are: a lot of the media I like, my
  keyboard, even the watch I'm currently wearing is a

<h3>Admiration</h3>
<p>
  Sharing this love, and I want to give <strong>appreciation</strong> to a few
  movies, series, artists, and things &mdash; some more obvious than others, but
  all great examples of cassette futurism.
