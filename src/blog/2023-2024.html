<h3>Looking back at <time>2023</time></h3>
<p>
  As much as it is a cliché, <strong>what a year</strong>, in private as well as
  professional. My daughter had her second birthday this year, and seeing her
  grow up, start to speak, and develop fantasy and imagination was unbelievable.
  My wife also made a huge decision this year, going self-employed starting her
  own business, and I couldn't be more excited for her.
</p>
<p>
  We also moved inside Sweden, from V&auml;sterhaninge to Bruzaholm, a small
  place in Sm&aring;land. It is a wonderful little house we rent here, with
  nature outside our doorstep.

<p>
  In May, I celebrated <strong>working a year in games</strong> at King (<abbr
    title="Activision Blizzard King"
    >ABK</abbr
  >), which has now been bought by Microsoft. I have an amazing time with my
  team, mainly because they're all the most knowledgeable and fun people you can
  have as colleagues. Besides, I get all the support from King I could wish for
  my day-to-day work as well as my personal development.
</p>

<h3>Diving deeper into C++</h3>
<p>
  One of my goals for the last few years has been to really learn C++, and this
  year I could really apply my knowledge. At work as well as on
  <a
    href="https://github.com/MartinHelmut"
    title="My personal GitHub page showing project I maintain."
    >open source projects</a
  >, I was able to do at least some C++ work every week, learning something new.
  I really want to keep that pace for <time>2024</time>, diving ever so deeply
  into the language and ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  I also worked a lot with CMake and its bundled tools like CTest and CPack,
  extended my
  <a
    href="https://github.com/MartinHelmut/cpp-gui-template-sdl2"
    title="C++ GUI starter template with SDL2 on GitHub."
    >C++ GUI application starter template</a
  >
  with a lot more features, started working on a better
  <strong>cross-platform tool set</strong>, and created a few articles around
  CMake and CPack I'm rather fond of.
</p>

<h3>So much more 3D</h3>
<p>
  Another goal I have had for a couple of years now is to <em>"learn 3D"</em>,
  or more specifically, tools to create. In the middle of the year, I set myself
  <a
    href="/blog/weekly-3d-challenge-first-results"
    title="Article about the 3D challenge I started in 2023."
    >the challenge of creating something in Blender every week for a year</a
  >. When the year is over, I will make a new article showing what I have and
  how the challenge went for me.
</p>
<p>
  But besides that challenge, I learned even more: I started working on a
  complex spaceship, including its interior, texturing, animations, VFX, sound,
  and more. A <strong>humongous project</strong>, yes, but one I chip away at
  piece by piece, no time pressure, happy I can create something complex like
  this.
</p>

<h3>With Lua to the moon</h3>
<p>
  If I really learned something this year, it was Lua, and I love it. I used and
  knew it already somewhat, but this year I went deep and started a whole
  <a
    href="/series/lua"
    title="Landing page for the Lua article series I'm writing."
    >article series</a
  >
  about it, going into a lot of aspects of the language and ecosystem.
</p>

<h3>Creating a world: <em>Alsafi</em></h3>
<p>
  <a
    href="/blog/to-create-a-world-from-scratch"
    title="Article I wrote about Alsafi, the sci-fi world I'm creating."
    ><em>Alsafi</em>, the name I gave the fictional, retro-futuristic sci-fi
    world I'm creating.</a
  >
  This year I started the project that had been in my head for a long time with
  scattered notes and ideas everywhere, and I am working on bringing everything
  together in regard to the world building.
</p>
<p>
  The current plan is a massive one: <strong>a book</strong>,
  <strong>a game</strong>, and <strong>a short film</strong>. Reading this, I
  still think I'm probably taking on too much, but hey, I won't stop myself. I'm
  already rather far with the book; I'm in preproduction for the game with
  concepts, working on the story, and I know where the short film will tie in
  with a rough story outline. All three media will be standalone, but together
  they tell a larger story in the world of <em>Alsafi</em>.
</p>

<h3>My love for books</h3>
<p>
  Continuing a trend from last year, I've read a lot. I love my books, I love
  all the books, to be honest. I've got myself some nice technical books, to
  name only a few, like
  <a
    href="https://hypermedia.systems"
    title="Home for the Hypermedia Systems book, also available online."
    >Hypermedia Systems</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"
    title="Wikipedia page for the book The Mythical Man-Month."
    >The Mythical Man-Month</a
  >. My new <em>Ada as a Second Language</em> book is going next to the
  <em>COBOL</em> by
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_D._McCracken"
    title="Wikipedia page about the software engineer Daniel D. McCracken."
    >Daniel D. McCracken</a
  >
  because I have a thing for old languages. But I also read all
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)"
    title="Wikipedia page about the Expanse book series."
    >The Expanse</a
  >
  books &mdash; an amazing sci-fi series. I continued reading
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time"
    title="Wikipedia page about the Wheel of Time book series."
    >The Wheel of Time</a
  >, went through
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)"
    title="Wikipedia page about the Three Body Problem book."
    >The Three Body Problem</a
  >, and had quite a good time with

    title="Wikipedia page about the book A History of What Comes Next by Sylvain Neuvel."

  >.
</p>

<h3>What I played this year</h3>
<p>
  I love video games; I've played a bunch of them. I
  <strong>won't rank</strong> any, I only want to mention some of those I played
  in <time>2023</time>.
</p>

<h4>Dead Space Remake</h4>
<p>
  I waited quite a bit for this one, loving the original. I watched the
  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MhcgejjiPs&list=PLAaNU3kGQxgQ-aUrR9fCoFuUIHDm1n8T6&index=18"
    title="Playlist on YouTube about the development of the Dead Space Remake."
    >developer video log</a
  >
  about the development and was super excited about the release; it
  <strong>did not disappoint</strong>. It captured all I love about the
  original, not changing too much, rather improving on aspects and even adding
  some extra lore and things to discover.
</p>

<h4>Tunic</h4>
<p>
  I did not expect what
  <a href="https://tunicgame.com" title="Webpage for the game Tunic.">Tunic</a>
  gave me. The cute Zelda-like game with the little fox I wanted to quickly play
  became <strong>one of my highlights</strong> from <time>2023</time>. Deep with
  lore, great combat, challenging puzzles, and even a whole language to deceive,
  this is a must-play that I can wholeheartedly recommend.
</p>

<h4>Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores</h4>
<p>
  Burning Shores is the DLC for one of my favourite games of <time>2022</time>,
  Horizon: Forbidden West. I loved it, even if it was not all I was hoping for.
  The new characters are amazing, the development of Aloy, the dynamic with
  Seyka, and the final battle &mdash; wow. Nevertheless, even if it looks
  stunning, the map area of the DLC was not what I would have hoped for and felt
  somewhat empty in parts, or at least did not give me the insensitive to
  explore much.
</p>

<h4>Alien: Isolation</h4>
<p>
  I will use every chance to bring up this horrifically delightful game, which
  will be <strong>10 years old in <time>2024</time></strong
  >. I kind of play it at least once per year, between watching Alien and
  Aliens, and last year was no exception. Though, in <time>2023</time>, I
  finally got the Platinum on my PlayStation, I played it a couple of times
  more. And I'll probably play it again <time>2024</time>, what a great game!
</p>

<h4>The Witcher 3</h4>
<p>
  For some reason, I felt like I needed to play The Witcher 3 again, enhanced
  edition, with all the DLC. And even after all this time, it is such a good
  game. A truly astonishing one I played for the nth-time again, triggering the
  fact that I had to <strong>re-read all the books</strong> again. No regrets.
</p>

<h4>Cyberpunk 2077 - Phantom Liberty</h4>
<p>
  I already said it in my last year's retrospective that I cannot wait to play
  the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty. I love Cyberpunk 2077, it is
  literally <strong>my favourite game from CD Project</strong>, even over The
  Witcher 3. Yes, I know. And I finally played the expansion.
</p>
<p>
  What the heck, that damn expansion made me tear up, laugh, and even dream
  about it. It was more than I was ever hoping for with an expansion of the base
  game. It had everything, world-class writing, music, and gameplay. The
  <strong>story blew me away</strong> and tied me to my controller the whole
  time. I would like to forget everything, so I can experience it again. The
  <a
    href="https://youtu.be/u15tEo0wsQI?si=wbMrPSnY86S2OvAQ"
    title="Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty main theme"
    >main theme song</a
  >
  is one I can listen to all the time, stuck in my head.
</p>

<h4>Alan Wake 2</h4>
<p>
  My <strong>game of the year <time>2023</time></strong
  >. Even though I'm not super happy with the ending &mdash; the new game plus
  made it that much better &mdash; Alan Wake 2 was brilliant. Everything felt so
  polished &mdash; the writing, gameplay, and graphics. The soundtrack is
  unbelievable, thinking about the
  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxs_HYw_mLk"
    title="The official Alan Wake 2 music video for Herald of Darkness."
    >mid-game musical</a
  >
  I felt part of or the chapter songs I have to now listen to again and again.
  That game Remedy made fully immersed me in its world.
</p>
<p>
  So much that I had to replay Control again right after playing Alan Wake 2,
  because I needed more of that type of game. And after Control, I also played
  Quantum Brake again, even if it is quite different from the other two.
</p>

<h4>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</h4>
<p>
  Almost wrapping up the year, I played
  <a href="https://www.hellblade.com" title="Website for the game Hellblade."
    >Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</a
  >
  on Xbox. Even though it came out in <time>2017</time>, I only played it now
  with little expectations. The world and story told about Senua and her
  struggle deeply touched me. I was much more sucked into it than I expected
  when I started the game I randomly saw on Game Pass. Now I'm looking forward
  to the second part, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2.
</p>

<h3>My past goals</h3>
<p>
  It is funny now for me to look back at the
  <a href="/blog/2022-2023" title="My last years retrospective for 2023."
    >last New Year's article</a
  >
  and the goals I was setting myself. I thought I would do much worse, or rather
  less, but there were only two goals I did not reach: learning Unreal Engine
  and releasing
  <a
    href="https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr/milestone/2"
    title="The GitHub milestone for Litr version 1."
    >Litr version 1</a
  >. And, to be honest, I'm fine with that.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of learning Unreal Engine, I started learning Godot and had a lot of
  fun with it, even if I'm not a big fan of GDScript. And Litr version 1 did not
  happen, as I focused on other learning areas. Not that I abandoned Litr, the
  opposite; I started working on it again with a clear goal and even more ideas;
  though I did not prioritise it in <time>2023</time> as the current version
  already did what I needed it to do.
</p>

<h3>Onwards to <time>2024</time></h3>
<p>Again, no predictions, only goals for the new year I hope to achieve.</p>

<h4>1. Having fun</h4>
<p>
  I will keep that one as number one. Having fun, learning something new, and
  prioritising my and my family's well-being. There's
  <strong>no need to get burned out</strong>
  over anything.
</p>

<h4>2. <em>Alsafi</em></h4>
<p>
  This is a big one for me. I want to get the book I'm writing into a good shape
  and at least start with the game. Also, there is the website
  <a
    href="https://alsafi.world"
    title="Website for the world of Alsafi, a retro sci-fi world."
    >alsafi.world</a
  >, which I have been preparing for a while now, telling about the world,
  places, people, events, and more.
</p>

<h4>3. Keep on keeping on 3D</h4>
<p>
  With all the 3D I did in <time>2023</time> and even more I want to do in
  <time>2024</time>, I also want to publish a portfolio with my works. Sure, I'm
  not a professional, but <strong>I love doing 3D</strong>, and I have some
  stuff I'm kind of proud of, so why not show it?
</p>

<h4>4. Litr version 1</h4>
<p>
  This year it'll happen, I'm sure. But for real, I have a plan and want to
  connect Litr version 1 to my C++ and Lua learnings.
</p>

<h4>5. Blogging</h4>
<p>
  With every article I write, I try to focus on
  <strong>quality over quantity</strong>. I do not publish often &mdash; roughly
  once per month &mdash; but I love what I publish. And I want to keep that:
  Focusing on what I like about my articles, making them the kind of content I
  like to consume.
</p>

<h4>6. Surprising myself</h4>
<p>
  Same as last year, who knows what <time>2024</time> brings? Maybe I change
  plans, or find something new that captures my imagination, I cannot predict
  the future. Whatever will happen, I want good, fun, intense, happy,
  intriguing, positive, exciting, lovely, exceptional, marvellous, surprising,
  &hellip; moments in <time>2024</time>.
</p>

<p>Until then 👋🏻</p>
