  Move it! By <strong>rigging and animating the door</strong>, or learning how
  to do it first. After

  >; I was ready to finally animate the door in Blender. Looking at what I've
  got so far I've &hellip; wait a second, I did the main door wrong.
</p>
<p>
  On closer inspection of Ron Cobb's sketch, my wife pointed out that the
  shadows on the door, what I thought are extruded parts, are actually insets.

</figure>
<p>
  Does that mean I have to redo parts of the door? I didn't think so, at first,
  but the ever growing <strong>whisper of doubt</strong> crept into my ear. I
  cannot un-see it, I will always know the mistake I made. In the first part of
  this article series I wrote:
</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote
    cite="https://martin-fieber.de/blog/bulkhead-door-with-blender-part-1/"
  >
    <p>
      What I wanted was to recreate his drawing as good as I could, as close as
      possible, and this is what I set out to do.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</figure>
<p>And this is what I will set out to do indeed.</p>

<h3 id="new-year-new-door">New year, new &hellip; door?</h3>
<p>
  Looking at the drawing again, I found another oversight &mdash; a small inset
  running around the edge of the main frame of the door. With the extrusions on
  the door, that are actually insets, this makes two mistakes I have to correct.
</p>
<figure>

<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Taking this as an opportunity, and applying
    <strong>all I learned throughout last year</strong>, I wanted to recreate
    the main door and change the frame. While on it, I will also rework parts of
    my topology and fully redo my, as I know now, horrible <abbr>UVs</abbr>*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      *Horrible, among other things, because there were stretches and obvious
      seams.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Adding the inset around the main door-frame's edge was quickly done. The
  actual door I <strong>rebuild from scratch</strong>, this time having inset
  parts on the surface of the door, similar to the inner barrier doors. I also
  reduced the segment count on all bevels, decreasing the overall poly-count, as
  I want to use the door in a game engine.

<p>
  Happy, knowing I did what I could to finally recreate Ron Cobb's drawing as
  close as possible, I was able to move on, as I already did twice in the
  previous articles of this series.
</p>

<h3>Stop! Render time.</h3>
<p>
  While texturing the door, even though happy with the workflow provided by
  <a
    href="https://www.blendermarket.com/products/fluent-materializer"
    title="The add-on main page on BlenderMarket."
    >Fluent: Materializer</a
  >, there was one thing that kept me worried: my render times.
  <strong>Every single render</strong> I did from the door
  <strong>took roughly 15 to 25 minutes</strong> on my machine, an Apple MacBook
  Air with M1 chip. This was due to the procedural materials and limitations of
  my system, so I assumed.
</p>
<p>
  A reasonable fix should be by baking the procedural materials to static
  textures. Even though
  <a
    href="https://cgthoughts.com/fluent/materializer/doc/baking_tool/"
    title="Official add-on documentation website about baking support."
    >Fluent: Materializer comes with baking support</a
  >, this <strong>never really worked for me</strong>. The main issue was that I
  was only able to bake one material at a time. In the end I wanted to have one
  texture for everything.
</p>
<p>
  One way I could solve that is by baking every material, one at a time, and
  with some image processing software combine those images into one texture.
  Thinking about an efficient workflow, this did <strong>not</strong> struck me
  as a scalable approach.
</p>

<h3>Simple bake, with SimpleBake</h3>
<p>
  The

    title="Official add-on website for SimpleBake on BlenderMarket."
    >Blender add-on SimpleBake</a
  >
  got my back &mdash; no affiliation, just a happy user. To use it I had to
  prepare some things. For one, I needed to ensure that my <abbr>UVs</abbr> do
  not have any overlapping islands; after my last rework this was easy enough
  and already done.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    Still learning, and <abbr>UVs</abbr> are hard. I acknowledge the empty space
    could be used better.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Second and last I needed to <strong>configure SimpleBake</strong>; give it a
  list of objects to bake, what textures to create, texture resolution, how to
  export, and if a copy of the objects with the applied textures should be
  created inside the project.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  After having this set up once for the project, I can
  <strong>bake and re-bake textures with one click</strong>. The results were
  amazing &mdash; my render times went
  <strong>from extremes like 25 minutes to 1 minute max</strong> with the static
  textures applied.

    All textures are baked, the door still looks like before, but renders a lot
    faster.

<p>
  Being now able to quickly render the door, my worries baked away, I could
  continue with rigging.
</p>

<h3>Bones and Drivers</h3>
<p>
  Before I found the
  <a
    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbjn7kaP877u1sX4zl081V8jUeSHDY18G"
    title="YouTube playlist about rigging and drivers in Blender from Level Pixel Level."
    >Drivers Master Class for Blender</a
  >
  video series from
  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/@LevelPixelLevel"
    title="YouTube channel of Level Pixel Level."
    >Level Pixel Level</a
  >
  I thought armatures and drivers where pure magic. Now that I went through that
  playlist, <strong>getting myself familiar with drivers</strong>, it still
  feels like magic, but right at my fingertips. Applying what I've learned, I
  threw some bones, or armatures, on my door.
</p>

  </picture>
  <figcaption>My doors bones, rendered in front of the mesh.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  The plan then was to <em>"drive"</em> those bones through a
  <em>controller</em>, keeping everything together by a set of
  <em>constrains</em>. Starting of by right-clicking on the bones y-location to
  add a driver.

  In the <em>Drivers</em> panel I defined the <em>"scripted expression"</em>,
  connected it to my <em>controller</em>, and added limits to the movement of
  the bone to drive.

<p>
  For the <em>controller</em> I created an arrow out of a plane, to which all
  bones are connected by there respective <em>driver</em>. The arrow also gets
  an <strong>object constraint</strong> to limit the movement, just for my own
  convenience.

  All in all, drivers felt somewhat natural &mdash; with functions and
  properties, resembling programming to a degree, giving me a kind of
  familiarity.
</p>

<h3>Move it!</h3>
<p>
  Having the door-rig ready, I used the controller to drive the animation of the
  door. I know there are <strong>many ways to do this</strong>, but this way
  felt like a solid choice for me at the time.

<p>
  Watching my animation too many times left me feel
  <strong>somewhat unsatisfied</strong>. I looked at a lot of reference doors,
  tried to tweak the animation timing, made it that parts of the door animate at
  different times; all to get a more natural feel of the door moving.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not quite there yet, but will continue nonetheless. Maybe future me has
  some good ideas improving the animation further.
</p>

<h3>Final animation</h3>
<p>
  Door rigged, animation set up, <strong>time to hit export</strong>. For this I
  export an image sequence I then combined to a movie through Blenders
  <em>Video Editing</em> view.

<h3>What comes next?</h3>
<p>
  After having the basics of rigging, animation, and drivers covered, I want to
  deepen that knowledge &mdash; getting more modelling experience can't hurt
  either. Therefore, my next step will be to
  <strong>model a hallway</strong> incorporating the door, add some slight
  <abbr>VFX</abbr>, and animate a camera moving through the environment.
</p>
<p>But that will be in part 4 of the project. Until then 👋🏻</p>
