<h3>In the beginning, there was light</h3>
<p>
  When I
  <a
    href="/blog/i-started-learning-3d"
    title="Article about the beginning of my journey learning 3D art."
    >started my journey into learning 3D</a
  >
  at the <time datetime="2022-01">beginning of 2022</time>, I began with small
  studies of light after the usual beginner tutorials. Small creations here,
  some tutorials there. Eventually, I started,
  <strong>and still work on</strong>, a bigger project for me:
  <a
    href="/series/bulkhead-door-with-blender"
    title="Article series about me creating the iconic bulkhead door as imagined by Ron Cobb."
    >recreating Ron Cobb's bulkhead door</a
  >
  he drew for the movie Alien. Even though I created and learned many aspects of
  3D creation, I never developed a habit of creating. A challenge was born.
</p>

<h3>Developing a habit</h3>
<p>
  The idea was quickly formed: the same way I made writing a habit by publishing
  at least one article every month, I'll
  <strong>make 3D creation a habit</strong>. The time interval I chose was once
  per week, as I felt this aligned best with my life &mdash; I always want to
  have time for family, I have a full-time job, and I have other projects I'm
  continuously working on.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    When writing, I use the fact that I constantly like to learn new things. I
    take what I've learned or a topic I think is interesting and make it an
    article. This way, I never have to think about what to write; there is
    always something to pick from*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      * I indeed have a rather large backlog of article ideas. I
      <em>"just"</em> need more time &hellip;
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Utilizing the same synergies for my 3D learning, I want to create objects,
  environments, textures, and effects that <em>"count towards a goal"</em>. As
  mentioned, I always have other projects I'm working on, and one of those is a
  world I'm building.
</p>
<p>
  The world-building helps me write more and learn how to craft stories.
  <a
    href="/blog/to-create-a-world-from-scratch"
    title="Article about Alsafi, the sci-fi world I'm creating."
    >I'm developing a retro sci-fi world</a
  >, strongly influenced by movies like Alien and Blade Runner, leaning toward a
  <a
    href="/blog/cassette-futurism"
    title="My article about my endless love for cassette futurism."
    >cassette futurism</a
  >
  theme.
</p>
<p>
  Considering this, I use the work I'm already doing as fuel for ideas for my 3D
  weekly challenge. I want to create what could be found in that world,
  <em>Alsafi</em>&nbsp;(<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"
    title="Help:IPA/English on Wikipedia"
    class="ipa"
    >/<span title="/æ/: 'a' in 'bad'">æ</span><span title="'l' in 'lie'">l</span
    ><span title="/ˈ/: primary stress follows">ˈ</span
    ><span title="'s' in 'sigh'">s</span
    ><span title="/eɪ/: 'a' in 'face'">eɪ</span
    ><span title="'f' in 'find'">f</span
    ><span title="/i/: 'y' in 'happy'">i</span>/</a
  >), as I currently have it named.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, I'd also like to <strong>learn something new</strong> with every
  weekly challenge. With goals set, and the inspiration pool initialized, a
  habit can be born.
</p>

<h3>6 weeks in</h3>
<p>
  Now that I've started the challenge, I've already learned a lot. This new
  habit was one of the best decisions I made to really boost my 3D learning. I
  tried different modeling techniques, with and without Blender add-ons, and
  even started learning
  <a
    href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-designer.html"
    title="Official Adobe Substance Designer landing page."
    >Substance 3D Designer</a
  >
  to create procedural textures.
</p>
<p>
  Up to this point, I'm really happy with the challenge, even if I'm usually not
  fully happy with the result. But the constraints are set, and what I have at
  the end of the week is what I have. Besides, that limit really helps me not
  fall into <em>"perfectionism"</em>, where everything needs to be 100% perfect
  &mdash; looking at you

    title="Here I wrote about how I, again, reworked a model for the nth time."
    >bulkhead door I've remodeled three times</a
  >.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    From the moment I came up with the challenge, I thought
    <strong>I want to do this for one year</strong>. Telling others, like my
    wife, about this, it seems like a rather ambitious goal. I'm not turning
    back though, I want to do it. I'll see how giddy and excited I am in
    <time datetime="2024-05-06">week 19, 2024</time>*.

<h3>Show and tell</h3>
<p>
  Alright, let's take a look at the random assortment of things I made in the
  first 6 weeks.
</p>

<h4><em>MyMuse</em> &mdash; motivational quote player</h4>
<p>
  The first asset I created is a small, handheld device that will play
  inspirational and motivational quotes &mdash; exclusively. Its advanced
  software will always produce the right quote for the right situation. The mono
  headphone helps to not get too distracted.
</p>

<p>
  I used a few Blender add-ons for this, mainly
  <a

    title="HardOps documentation website"
    >HardOps</a

  <a

  >
  for textures, and
  <a href="https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/" title="DECALmachine landing page"
    >DECALmachine</a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Another sci-fi door</h4>
<p>
  As it took me quite a while to build my first larger asset,
  <a
    href="/series/bulkhead-door-with-blender"
    title="My article series about me creating a sci-fi bulkhead door in Blender."
    >a bulkhead door</a
  >, I challenged myself to do another one &mdash; but quicker. To keep an eye
  on the time, I stuck to basic textures, and am very happy with the result,
  that took me a fraction of the time I took for my first sci-fi door.

  and

    >DECALmachine</a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Zero-G retro lamp</h4>
<p>
  Who does not want a space-compatible, retro-looking lamp with cozy vibes? This
  lamp can stick to flat surfaces to avoid floating in zero-G. Bringing the cozy
  vibes of the past to modern spaceships.

<p>
  I used Blender without add-ons for the lamp, with the goal of getting at the
  subdivision workflow.
</p>

<h4>Procedural ground dirt material</h4>
<p>
  Dirt! That's it &mdash; though not all of it. I wanted to learn procedural
  texture creation and delved into my first steps with
  <a
    href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-designer.html"
    title="Adobe Substance 3D Designer landing page."
    >Substance 3D Designer</a
  >. I had a lot of fun working on this and definitely want to create more
  textures this way in the future.

<h4>Vacuum carry case</h4>
<p>
  This one was harder than imagined. I wanted to create a hard-case for secure
  storage and transport of small goods. I fiddled way too long with the
  topology, again diving into <em>"making things perfect"</em>. In the end, time
  ran out, and I was not able to finish it all.

  for the labeling.
</p>

<h4>Sodium borohydride storage</h4>
<p>
  Inspired by one of <em>Alsafi's</em> colonies, this large
  <a

  tank will help store its contents securely against the planet's high
  atmospheric pressure. It is used to safely store hydrogen in a solid state.

  I always wanted to try a blueprint look, which I accomplished here via
  Blender's grease pencil tool and the amazing
  <a
    href="https://youtu.be/jQqUQ5JOZjY"
    title="SouthernShotty's YouTube channel"
    >SouthernShotty tutorial on YouTube</a
  >. With more time, I would have liked to also add measurements to the storage
  tank &mdash; thankfully, there is always next time.
</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>
  Alright, this is what I have so far. I'm really looking forward to when the
  year is done and I can look at 52 creations &mdash; hoping to see how I got
  better. Thumbs pressed. I also plan on
  <strong>creating a proper portfolio</strong> when I'm done, showcasing every
  item in high resolution.
</p>
<p>Until then 👋🏻</p>
