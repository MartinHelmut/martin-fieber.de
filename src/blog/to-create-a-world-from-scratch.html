<h3>&hellip; one must first invent the universe.</h3>
<p>
  Or whatever Carl was saying, but I for sure want more than an apple. Anyway,
  already as a child, I loved imagining my own worlds, coming up with what the
  people would be like, the technology, the day of a regular child &mdash; now
  it's the day of an adult, not much has changed. I still
  <strong>love imagining worlds</strong> &mdash; sci-fi worlds in particular.
  And because of that, I one day decided to do just that &mdash; write down a
  world, making it more than just the shifting images and words in my head.
</p>
<p>
  I have many ideas about many things. I'm not saying they're all good or
  original, but I like them. And ideas about things I like are even more
  plentiful.
  <a
    href="/blog/cassette-futurism"
    title="In this article I share my love for cassette futurism."
    >Cassette futurism</a
  >, as seen in Blade Runner or Alien (<time>1979</time>); anything sci-fi, with
  spaceships, exploring new worlds; software, and what it can or cannot do in
  our lives.
</p>
<p>
  When I say I want to create a world, writing it down does not feel like enough
  to capture what I want to pour out of my head. There are images, music,
  specific sounds, and feelings that need to be invoked. Even though I started
  this blog to get better at writing, I'm not sure whether I can bring all of
  this down to words yet, and still, I want to write, tell a story, invoke
  feelings, show what this world looks like, and &hellip;
</p>

<h3>Everything</h3>
<p>
  I plan. I'm a planner. Sylvain Neuvel once said he plans and writes his books
  like lasagna. He starts each chapter very thin, sometimes just one sentence,
  and layers them up until he is happy. Using the same metaphor, I see myself as
  <strong>planning a hunter's pot</strong>. I take different concepts and ideas
  and let them cook forever, taking a bowl out for a specific story and never
  emptying the pot.
</p>
<p>
  My people, groups, places, and world are not functions of a specific story
  that solely evolves from one concrete implementation. They all make up
  everything, and I find a story in that place. This is at least how I would
  describe what happened when I set out to create a world.
</p>
<p>
  I started imagining the basic setup: where is everyone? How should this world
  look? Then I filled it with ideas, events, and groups; then people, unions,
  corporations, and religions; even tech, jobs, and software. What constraints
  are present, <strong>what drives people</strong>, and why are they there?
</p>

<h3>A book, a game, a film?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Yes, all of it.</strong> After a while of working on my world, stories
  emerged naturally.
</p>
<p>
  I could write a <strong>short story</strong> about that mining corporation on
  planet <em>Athree</em> and the miner who killed their supervisor with a wrench
  after they found out what the corp' was drilling for.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>game</strong> where you are a train driver who discovers a signal in
  the middle of nowhere, thinking this could be a sign of the long-lost colony
  that first came to the system.
</p>
<p>
  Or an <strong>animated short film</strong>, following a lone space trucker
  delivering a large crate only labeled <em>"Rats <abbr>MK</abbr>4"</em> to a
  remote outpost to get her union benefits, trying not to care about why the
  crate vibrates from time to time.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Of course, I have to pick some of it, no? I cannot do it all &mdash;
    probably. But I'm also a hopeless optimist, so I started writing a short
    story, working on a game, and learning to animate a short film. Even if none
    of it ever sees the light of day, I'm having a blast. Partially, though,
    things will see some light as I write this article, taking a first step and
    telling about my world*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* I do have a plan for how to pull that off, but I'll explain later.</p>

  Around <time>2032</time>, a breakthrough in
  <dfn><strong>magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (<abbr>MPDT</abbr>)</strong></dfn>
  technology enabled faster space travel and greatly reduced the time to reach
  the stars &mdash; or at least objects in our solar system. It took until
  <time>2061</time>, with the invention of the so-called
  <dfn
    ><em><abbr>GEM</abbr> Engine</em>, a
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitoelectromagnetism"
      title="Wikipedia page about Gravitoelectromagnetism."
      >gravitoelectromagnetic</a
    >
    generator</dfn
  >
  that creates artificial gravity, before we were truly able to reach the stars
  and live permanently in space.
</p>
<p>
  In <time>2081</time>, a colony ship called the <em>Onveer</em> left Sol on its
  way to <em>Alsafi</em>, also known as <em>Sigma Draconis</em>, a single star
  in the northern constellation of <em>Draco</em>. It's a real system, 18.8
  light years from our sun, and <strong>the name I gave my world</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This starship did broadcast its journey, which took over 40 years, before
  arriving in the system &mdash; it indeed turned out to be as rich in resources
  as promised. I loosely based it on the real system, though I added more
  planets and moons besides the currently known ones.
</p>
<p>
  In my world, the system was picked because it was a promising candidate for
  habitable planets. The most promising planets were one covered fully in water,
  later called <em>Frisicum Planes</em>, and another rocky planet, just called
  <em>A3</em>, as the third planet in the system, with a solid surface at 1.2 of
  Earth's <abbr>G</abbr>, covered in water clouds with constant storms around
  the equator, that can only be traversed via vehicle or environment suits.
</p>
<p>
  Around <time>2126</time>, and shortly after the new colony reworked the ship
  that brought them there to its first station, <em>Port Neha</em>, with a
  permanent orbit around Frisicum Planes, the last broadcast reached Sol in
  <time>2145</time> &mdash; unremarkable, as usual, reporting on the progress of
  the colony. After that,
  <strong>no new signal left <em>Alsafi</em></strong> from the first colony.
</p>
<p>
  In <time>2157</time>, 12 years after Sol retrieved the last broadcast, a
  second colony ship started its journey to the system. After only 38 years of
  travel, in <time>2195</time>, the second ship arrived in the system, finding
  the colony ship and established station of the first colonists initially
  closed off, clean, and without traces of the people who once inhabited the
  space.
</p>
<p>
  Years passed, and <strong>people moved on</strong>. The system got colonized,
  stations were built, and trade routes established. Only a few are still
  looking for what happened to the first colonists. Some see it as a sign,
  others as a warning. Children tell each other ghost stories about the
  long-lost colony; most people don't even think about them anymore.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The year now is <time>2237</time></strong
  >, 42 years after the second colony ship arrived. The main hubs of this new
  world are Port Neha, in orbit around the water planet Frisicum Planes, now
  called <em>Frisland</em>, and <em>Thrumuland</em>, a colony on planet A3,
  renamed <em>Athree</em>, producing hydrogen as sodium borohydride and being a
  major economic force, led by the <em>"Thrumuland Trade Union"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  What was once unclear in the beginning &mdash; if the settlers could survive
  on their own in this new world &mdash; is now clear: yes. Due to the very
  favorable conditions of <em>Alsafi</em> the new frontier strove in no time,
  creating their own laws, rules, and customs &mdash; eventually a society
  detached from Earth, where all once began.
</p>
<p>
  That's the short base the world is built upon: a retro-futuristic sci-fi
  world, leaning toward cassette futurism, grounded, only partially explored,
  with the feeling of great opportunity awaiting.
</p>

<h3>A journey, together</h3>
<p>
  I have a ton more information about the world, the people, unions and
  corporations, communities, places, technology, ideologies, religions, events,
  etc., and I want to view it somewhere. Currently, everything is in Markdown
  files managed through
  <a
    href="https://obsidian.md"
    title="Homepage of Obsidian, a private and flexible note‑taking app."
    >Obsidian</a
  >. I love the tool, but I also want something more visual. So I made the
  decision to <strong>create an interactive website</strong>, hosting every
  information around the world and making it a design and world document I can
  then share and interact with, as well as gather early feedback to improve the
  world and my writing.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully, this will build up the world and fill it with everything to make it
  feel alive, then enrich it with stories. As said earlier, the idea is to
  create a small game, a book, and an animated short film, all following a
  different person in that world, doing their job and living their lives.
</p>
<p>
  Everything will help everything: synergies. The book will fill the world
  further, making it just that much bigger. This will help create the stories
  for the small game and short film. Furthermore, I will be able to reuse the
  assets, like 3D models, graphics, or sounds, I create for the game for the
  animated short film that I plan on creating with Blender, and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>Subject to change</h3>
<p>
  Even though I already have a lot of information created for the world, I'm not
  shy about cutting, changing, or reforming the world and the stories in it.
  <strong>Everything is subject to change</strong> if it helps create a better
  world. And until the actual release of the first story in that world, there is
  no reason not to, even if it means reworking large parts.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, that is the idea behind creating this world more or less in the
  open: <strong>getting active feedback</strong> to improve all aspects of it.
</p>

<h3>A plan, next?</h3>
<p>
  Next, I will work on the interactive website that will be available online at
  <a
    href="https://alsafi.world"
    title="The future website for all things Alsafi."
    >alsafi.world</a
  >, expanding the universe, as well as write updates here on my blog. As said,
  I want to create the world in the open, getting as much feedback as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The site will also already include some concept art of places and technologies
  in that world, created by the amazing
  <a
    href="https://www.artstation.com/kruger7215"
    title="Vitaliy's ArtStation portfolio"
    >Vitaliy Ostaschenko</a
  >, as well as a set of short stories I've already written.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    I know this is a lot, but I have time*. I have a day job, so I'm doing this
    on the side as a hobby because I like to. No deadlines, no financial
    pressure, thankfully. And due to the many different aspects of what I'm
    planning, I can switch things up: do something visual, write a new story, or
    work on code. <strong>It will never get boring.</strong>
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      * <em>"I have time"</em>, as in <em>"being in no hurry"</em>. Generally, I
      do not have time, probably due to projects like this.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Even more important, I will create my own tools to support this work as good
  as possible. I already have the basics of a world-building tool to help map
  events, locations, and people to a timeline. I will extend this tool to
  support the website I build and also integrate it into the game. A slice of
  that tool will even be open source, as I did with other projects of mine.
</p>
<p>
  And with this 18.8-light-years of journey ahead, I will chop it away, one step
  at a time.
</p>
<p>Until then 👋🏻</p>
