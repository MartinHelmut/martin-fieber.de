<h3 id="my-blog-my-opinions">My blog, my opinions</h3>
<p>
  As this is <strong>my personal</strong> blog, I sure hope every reader knows
  that my opinions will be part of it. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize this,
  especially for this article, that I put together based on my time in software
  development and what I experienced and what worked well.
</p>
<p>
  Still, it always depends on different factors and the given context &mdash; am
  I my own user, work for a small team, a large company, hobby, professional,
  budget, and many more. With this out of the way, let's go.
</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="not-only-good">It's not only good, &hellip;</h3>
<p>
  Internal-facing tools can be a lot of things; large and small
  <abbr>GUI</abbr> applications, code libraries, script tools,
  <abbr>APIs</abbr>, or even workflows for teams. Quite often, in my past, those
  tools were rather technical.
</p>
<p>
  Configuration through <abbr>JSON</abbr>, <abbr>YAML</abbr>, or
  <abbr>XML</abbr>; run through Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or a command-line
  script. A search that is based on regular expressions, a
  <dfn>Domain Specific Language (<abbr>DSL</abbr>)</dfn>, a release job used by
  non-technical people triggered through a cURL call, or a <abbr>REST</abbr>
  <abbr>API</abbr> so good that it <em>"documents itself"</em>.
</p>

<h3 id="good-enough">&hellip; it's good enough!</h3>
<p>
  I wrote this just for myself or my colleagues &mdash; I know, and they can ask
  me. Those designers just need to learn Git, my manager how to use
  <abbr>cURL</abbr>, they will manage. I will remember. In the end, I wrote the
  tool; what more?
</p>

<h3 id="no">No!</h3>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    <strong>This cannot be it.</strong> I am a user; my future self will not
    remember, and no, those designers should absolutely not be forced to learn
    Git*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      * I've heard this now so often that this really starts to rub me all the
      wrong ways.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Internal tools often get kind of a different status assigned, may it be from
  ourselves to ourselves or in the larger context of a company. Bugs get
  accepted, complexities are sold as necessities, and documentation points to a
  chat thread, calling it a day.
</p>
<p>
  I say no! <strong>Good enough is just not good.</strong> I should treat
  myself, my future self, my colleagues, and those that come after me better.
  Caring about internal tools and those users should be as natural as,
  hopefully, the care given to external users or anyone else.
</p>

<h3 id="but-why">But why?</h3>
<p>
  Better internal tools will result in <strong>fewer errors</strong>,
  <strong>save time</strong>, and <strong>reduce costs</strong>. Removing
  friction is another reason to even create internal tools in the first place,
  so why only go half-way?
</p>
<p>
  Good and comprehensive documentation reduces time spend searching for answers
  and help. Fewer bugs lead to less frustration and less time spent working
  around those issues. Happy users are more productive users; whether that is me
  or hundreds of others, it makes no difference.
</p>
<p>
  All this increases confidence in a tool and, therefore, confidence in my own
  abilities or the ones of my team &mdash; reducing maintenance costs,
  increasing reusability, and getting easier buy-ins later from users,
  management, or the infamous future self.
</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>
  I'll try to be constructive, not only talking about high-level concepts but,
  where possible, providing specific examples on how to
  <strong>create and improve internal tools</strong>. All of it should work,
  from a single person creating something amazing to a team working in a
  company, and I'll try to explain how this applies in those cases.
</p>
<p>
  But be aware that this is neither an exhaustive list nor a set of rules. More
  like guiding on what worked for me in the past, from private projects to the
  years of development in companies, small and large. I did not eat wisdom with
  a spoon, though I'm passionate about tool development and want us all to build
  great software and workflows. On top of that, many of the points work for
  general software development as well.
</p>
<p>With that being said, let's build awesome internal tools.</p>

<h3 id="me-user-colleague">
  1. Me, user, colleague &mdash; what's the difference?
</h3>
<p>
  Developing internal tools means, generally speaking, developing for
  colleagues, yourself, or both. Users should not be treated differently because
  of that, though this is often the case. Talking about those tools, starting
  sentences with <em>"This is just for &hellip;"</em>. <strong>Just</strong> for
  whom? The fundamental key to this endeavor is the person or group that will
  work with the tool.
</p>
<p>
  The mindset is important. How we speak is important. This is not
  <em>just</em>; this is for my amazing users, for my capable colleagues; this
  is for the magnificent me, now and in the future. Always remember.
</p>

<h3 id="ask-and-listen-never-assume">2. Ask and listen, never assume</h3>
<p>
  Too often, I see tools developed purely based on assumptions. Assuming how
  something should work, how people work together, and what the current process
  looks like. Sometimes, going ahead with a great idea and releasing it without
  having the actual user take a look at it before.
  <em>Assumptions Driven Development</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This is a problem that can easily be resolved. Even with the greatest of
  ideas, <strong>ask and listen first</strong>. What is really wanted? Where is
  the current problem or friction? What needs to be automated? Planning goes a
  long way, and planning also means getting all the requirements right first by
  talking to the target audience.
</p>
<p>
  What if this is <em>just</em> me? There it is again, <em>just</em>. Even for
  myself, I try to nail what I really want. Do I need to automate those two
  clicks here? Do I always want to write regular expressions for my most
  powerful search yet? When I want to extend this software later, is this
  exhaustive plugin system really the right solution? I'm a technical person,
  but is a technical solution what I want?
</p>
<p>
  It may seem obvious reading this, but reality shows it is not.
  <strong>Never assume</strong>, get all requirements, and involve users early.
  <em>Just</em> one benefit of internal tool development and reachable users.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, involving users means letting them collaborate early, shaping the
  future of what they will use (probably) daily, increasing the emotional value
  attached to it, and therefore often being more forgiving on bugs or small
  issues.
</p>

<h3 id="watch-them-work">3. Watch them work</h3>
<p>
  Asking and listening is nice, but like a picture saying more than 1000 words,
  watching someone work with a tool, workflow, or library can give more insight
  than any question could. Quite often, what others see as
  <em>"not worth mentioning"</em> when talking about a workflow can offer great
  potential for optimization. Important here is to capture this session in any
  capacity, e.g., written, as pictures, or a video capture.
</p>
<p>
  Too often I had a colleague skip over the fact they use two different tools
  for almost the same task, which for some reason resulted in saying
  <em>"This is how we always did this"</em>. There is
  <strong>no blame</strong> for the user in this, as
  <strong>long-time usage often leads to blind spots</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, how do I watch myself work, creating tools for my own needs? Observe via
  screen recording! Starting a recording and letting it run for a duration of
  time, doing the usual tasks, testing a new tool, and working on integrating it
  into an existing workflow. And then review the recording. This will help
  identify barriers and reveal blind spots, giving a different perspective.
</p>

<h3 id="the-time-in-between">4. The time in-between</h3>
<p>
  From my experience, automation and optimization of existing workflows and
  tools are not always what bring the biggest benefits. Looking at a day of
  work, where is all the time spent? Is it actually inside a tool, worth the
  effort to reduce four clicks to one, or is it context switching between
  different tools?
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Often it is the second, context switching, or glue-work*. If this is the
    case, this is where effort should be spent.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Make one thing work with another.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Removing time in between can mean changing the tool landscape or composition.
  Where an old process uses three different tools to solve a given task, it can
  become clear that two of those tools are always used together. This offers the
  potential for unification, changing the composition, and
  <strong>removing lost time in context switching</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  If tools cannot be unified, it is worth looking into other ways to reduce
  time. There could be a specific feature needed in one tool that can be
  transferred to another. Even if this means duplication, it can be worth it.
</p>
<p>
  What if, inside my tool landscape, one tool is owned by another team or
  person? Talk to them, listen, show them the problem, and, in the best case,
  give them ideas on how to solve it. Or try working with them on solving the
  issue. If this is for any reason not feasible, or they can or will not help,
  try a different way. Feature duplication, contributing to an external codebase
  &mdash; get creative.
</p>
<p>
  And sometimes, accept what is given. Create documentation about the issue and
  what was tried and discussed, and move on, spending your valuable time
  elsewhere.
</p>

<h3 id="looks-do-matter">5. Looks do matter</h3>
<p>
  There once was a documentation tool from a well-known company. It offered all
  one can dream of: editing without technical knowledge, a visual editor,
  rich-media support, integrations into other tools, even sharing documents with
  external users, and many more features. Yet no one wanted to use it. People
  even reacted with disgust, calling it a graveyard and worse. <em>"Why?"</em>,
  one might ask. <strong>It was not sexy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Even if a bit exaggerated, more often than not, looks can be the reason a
  totally capable tool is not accepted by users. What counts as good-looking is,
  of course, very subjective. The peak of beauty for one can be jarring for
  others.
</p>
<p>
  When working alone and creating tools for myself, it can be whatever I like
  most. Personally, I love a retro-futuristic style,
  <a
    href="/blog/cassette-futurism"
    title="My article on what I love about cassette futurism."
    >cassette futurism</a
  >, so I developed a theme and corresponding libraries I can use for all my
  tools. It is a retro pixel style, dark but with brightly colored accents, and
  otherwise kept very simple. The image in this article shows the exact theme in
  question. I love looking at it and using my tools.
</p>
<p>
  In a company, for many different users, it can be best to get someone who has
  knowledge of forming the <strong>user experience</strong> with design
  background (<abbr title="User Interface Design">UI</abbr>/<abbr
    title="User Experience Design"
    >UX</abbr
  >). Much can be learned and taught, but a professional is a professional
  &mdash; and best utilized from the beginning if available.
</p>
<p>
  If that's not an option, there is <strong>no shame in copying</strong> the
  style of others. One of the powers of developing an internal tool is freedom,
  including the freedom to copy. There are many great examples out there that
  can be adapted to your use case. Alternatively, a theme library can be another
  option.
</p>

  For the commonly used operating systems, Apple offers a list of great
  <a

    >designs and themes</a

  is another great choice with examples, articles, and tools.
</p>
<p>
  Looks are <strong>not restricted to <abbr>GUI</abbr> applications</strong>. A
  terminal <abbr>UI</abbr> is <abbr>UI</abbr>, too; a <abbr>CLI</abbr> can look
  nice; help text printed via <code>--help</code> formatted to be more readable.
  Even further, error messages should <em>"look good"</em>, aka. be very
  readable by a human.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of directly printing an error, the thought should always be,
  <em>"What error message actually helps?"</em>. Only showing what is directly
  helpful to resolve the problem. There can also be an error code or an
  additional tool to get further guidance on a problem. And if the user cannot
  do anything, how about not showing an error at all? Try to tell the user what
  will happen next, run a recovery, or, in the worst case, restart, but
  <strong>be transparent</strong>.
</p>

<h3 id="documentation-driven-development">
  6. Documentation Driven Development
</h3>
<p>
  Test driven development is nice, but have you ever tried documentation-driven
  development? It is the simple concept of
  <strong>writing the documentation first</strong>, before anything else.
  Specifying how a library is used, a program should work, an API look, and a
  <abbr>CLI</abbr> behave &mdash; for the user.
</p>
<p>
  This way of starting a project made the biggest change for my work, for the
  better. Usually I started with writing code; sometimes tests came first,
  sometimes not. <strong>Documentation always came later</strong>, always;
  sometimes never.
</p>
<p>
  From the day I started working documentation-driven, my tools got better,
  <abbr>APIs</abbr>
  more usable, extendable, and readable. This may sound like an exaggeration,
  but it is not. This really changed how I approach any tool since then.
</p>
<p>
  This works on any scale, too. When creating a new repository, a README should
  be the first file filled in and final. How to use the code, or library, in
  detail for all that is planned. It can also be applied to a single new feature
  for a bigger codebase or the next iteration of an application.
</p>
<p>
  It makes me really think about how I want something to be
  <strong>used in the best possible way</strong>, on a detailed level. Being the
  best version of myself, I implement tests next, including all code examples
  from the documentation, if present. Not because someone said this is how I
  should do it, but because it solves my next set of problems, the
  technicalities.
</p>
<p>
  At that point, I will hopefully have documentation, tests, and a big smile on
  my face. No matter how my implementation now looks, it is tested and can be
  used with an <abbr>API</abbr> I'm actually happy with.
</p>

<h3 id="prototype-iterate-implement">7. Prototype, iterate, implement</h3>
<p>
  Even on internal tooling, tackling a large new application or feature by
  starting off with a prototype is crucial to its successful adoption. A
  prototype in that context can be many things: a dummy created with a design
  tool; screens of what to expect; documentation explaining what will be
  available, going back to the
  <a href="#documentation-driven-development">documentation-driven approach</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is not important what the prototype is, but that it exists and can be used
  to iterate <strong>with users</strong>. If future users are already happy at
  that stage, they will look forward to actually working with the new tool they
  get, knowing what to expect.
</p>
<p>
  What if they're not happy? Iterate! Until they are happy. This can sometimes
  feel tedious, is often hard, and can take quite some time. But this initial
  time spent is well worth it, avoiding late conceptual changes and bigger
  refactors.
</p>
<p>
  Some great tools to create visual prototypes are
  <a
    href="https://penpot.app"
    title="Open-source, free, design and prototype tool."
    >Penpot</a
  >, free, open-source, and can even be self-hosted;
  <a href="https://www.figma.com" title="Design and prototype tool.">Figma</a>,
  which offers a free tier or a subscription-based price; and
  <a href="https://www.sketch.com" title="Design and prototype tool.">Sketch</a
  >, paid with either a monthly subscription or a one-time payment, also
  offering free tiers for education.
</p>

<h3 id="interlude">Interlude</h3>
<p>
  At this point, looking at all the previous guidance, the problem space is
  fully understood, the documentation is already written, a prototype is
  approved by happy users who look forward to getting a new shiny toy, and tests
  may be implemented as well, giving the tool implementer the highest confidence
  to actually go into development.
</p>
<p>
  This may sound like an unreachable scenario, and as context is everything, it
  sometimes is, but it is a scenario to strive for. In the end, as guidelines
  go, it is all about picking what works best for a given situation.
</p>

<h3 id="imagine-going-public">8. Imagine going public</h3>
<p>
  As a small mental exercise, look at an existing
  <strong>internal tool</strong> and think about what would need to be done to
  <strong>make it public</strong>. Is it a lot? Usual candidates are missing
  documentation, a user experience to be improved, or no way to monitor if
  everything actually works.
</p>
<p>
  This is <strong>not about actually going public</strong>, as a lot of those
  tools cover internal company processes or are integrated into systems that can
  not be disclosed for any reason. This is purely about the <em>what-if</em>,
  from a user perspective, and the therefore emerging question of <em>Why?</em>
</p>
<p>
  Can my colleagues not get the best experience? Can I? Why is that? Thinking
  about what is necessary to go public can be a valuable exercise to harden and
  improve a tool. One of those, often neglected, is monitoring.
</p>

<h3 id="monitor">9. Monitor</h3>
<p>
  Why should I monitor a tool used by a few? They will <em>just</em> write me
  when something does not work, won't they? Often not. For every user who wrote
  a bug ticket or a message in a chat, even more did not. Sometimes they find
  creative solutions, working around a problem or limitation of a tool, but in
  the end, they spend more time overall.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Monitoring will help</strong> catch this early. Having a central place
  for where your logs go, observing application performance, receiving alerts on
  errors, and recording user sessions when problems keep them stuck. There are
  many aspects to monitoring, and it all depends on the needs and goals set.
</p>
<p>
  It is valuable to gather information to help the users, solve problems
  quicker, and catch errors early. The more robust and hardened the software,
  the smaller the maintenance cost, saving time for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  In the past, I had some great experience with
  <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com" title="Datadog monitoring and alerting."
    >Datadog</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://sentry.io/"
    title="Sentry website, a tool for monitoring software."
    >Sentry</a
  >, both great tools to support different monitoring needs. To be fair, always
  in the context of multiple users, not when I worked on my own.
</p>

<h3 id="how-to-replace-existing-tools">10. How to replace existing tools?</h3>
<p>
  This is the tricky one and, quite often, the hardest requirement. Creating a
  new tool to replace one or more already in existence. There can be many
  reasons why a full replacement is needed, and before even considering it, it
  should always be evaluated if one or more tools can be refactored or improved
  instead. But when the decision is made, a big task lies ahead.
</p>
<p>
  An often very optimistic view is that a subset of features in a new tool will
  be enough to start replacing the existing one. This is not true; a new tool
  will need <strong>feature parity to get user acceptance</strong>. If this is
  not the case, users will, when given the option, continue using the old tool
  and workflow.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to bring users over to a not yet fully feature-complete
  replacement when providing a clear benefit that makes it worth it with a
  subset of the functionality. Nevertheless, all previous tasks need to be
  solvable in some capacity &mdash; with the old tool, a temporary alternative,
  or a new minimal version of what is already in place.
</p>
<p>
  What does help while developing the replacement in parallel is a
  <strong>feature freeze on the old tool</strong>. It is also well worth it to
  reuse what is possible, enabling a faster go-to-user. Reusing does not only
  mean code or design; it can also be a data format. Being able to run new and
  old in parallel is a huge benefit in this transition period.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of approach, the main goal needs to be that the new tool does
  provide a clear benefit, not just recreating what already existed (<a
    href="#watch-them-work"
    >see point 3</a
  >), with a <strong>100% adoption rate</strong>. Not planning to retire the old
  tool is a mistake that will increase maintenance costs.
</p>

<h3 id="a-new-release">11. A new release</h3>
<p>
  Rolling out a new release should be done with
  <strong>confidence and transparency</strong>. Confidence in having a setup
  that allows easy rollouts of new features to all users and being transparent
  about what will be released by announcing the changes. A good changelog will
  make a difference.
</p>
<p>
  Changelog generation is a very common practice that involves taking commit
  messages and packing them into a list of changes. Often done with tools like
  <a
    href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/"
    title="Commitizen is release management tool designed for teams."
    >Commitizen</a
  >, where commit message rules define change log categories and content &mdash;
  <strong>I would not use this</strong> for users.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of generated changelog is very technical and may be useful for
  developers working on a tool, but <strong>not for the end user</strong>. A
  good user changelog is human-readable, with focus on explaining or even
  showing new features and what user-reported issues were fixed.
</p>
<p>
  It doesn't even need to be complicated or have a lot of text &mdash; images or
  recordings go even further. Anything that helps your user understand what is
  new and how it works, maybe even making them excited to try out the new
  release.
</p>

<h3 id="you-are-never-really-done">12. You're never really done</h3>
<p>
  Ever heard <em>"When we finish this tool, we build the next"</em>? You're
  never done. Every new tool comes with new responsibilities. Fixing bugs,
  supporting new operating systems, and adding features. Saying a tool is done
  equals abandonment.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a problem but an opportunity &mdash; instead of creating a new
  tool, an existing one can be extended. Alternatively, maybe there is something
  <em>"off the shelf"</em>. Before creating a new one, all options need to be
  considered.
</p>
<p>
  Now, when creating a new tool and keeping future responsibility in mind,
  extensibility should be considered. Giving the user methods to extend the
  tool, write plugins, create visual extensions, and support admin roles that
  can configure aspects for others. Generally, making it possible for users to
  solve new problems with what is given.
</p>

<h3 id="above-and-beyond">13. Above and Beyond</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Going the extra mile is worth it.</strong> As said in the beginning,
  <em>"good enough is just not good"</em>. Of course, this is not always the
  case, but we should all challenge ourselves to really go above and beyond.
</p>

    Thinking from the users' perspective: fixing bugs, for example with
    reoccurring bug squashing days; getting regular feedback, this could be done

    borders.

  <strong>respect and care</strong> and
  <strong>creating amazing internal tools</strong>.

  decide what is important; sometimes I do a few, sometimes everything.

  As guidelines go, I pick, mix, and match as I please. Though if there is one
  thing to remember between tool creator and user, as the great
