<h3 id="my-blog-my-opinions">My blog, my opinions</h3>
<p>
  As this is <strong>my personal</strong> blog I sure hope every reader knows
  that my opinions will be part of it. Nevertheless, I want to emphasise this,
  especially for this article, that I put together based on my time in software
  development, with what I experienced and what worked well.
</p>
<p>
  Still, it always depends on different factors and the given context &mdash; am
  I my own user, work for a small team, a large company, hobby, professional,
  budget, and many more. Having this out of the way, let's go.
</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="not-only-good">It's not only good, &hellip;</h3>
<p>
  Internal facing tools can be a lot of things; large and small
  <abbr>GUI</abbr> applications, code libraries, script tools,
  <abbr>APIs</abbr>, or even workflows for teams. Quite often, in my past, those
  tools were rather technical.
</p>
<p>
  Configuration through <abbr>JSON</abbr>, <abbr>YAML</abbr>, or
  <abbr>XML</abbr>; run through Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or a command line
  script. A search that is based on regular expressions, a
  <dfn>Domain Specific Language (<abbr>DSL</abbr>)</dfn>, a release job used by
  non-technical people triggered through a cURL call, or a <abbr>REST</abbr>
  <abbr>API</abbr> so good, it <em>"documents itself"</em>.
</p>

<h3 id="good-enough">&hellip; it's good enough!</h3>
<p>
  I wrote this just for myself, or my colleagues &mdash; I know, and they can
  ask me. Those designers just need to learn Git, my manager how to use
  <abbr>cURL</abbr>, they will manage. I will remember. In the end, I wrote the
  tool, what more?
</p>

<h3 id="no">No!</h3>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    <strong>This cannot be it.</strong> I am a user, my future self will not
    remember, and no, those designers should absolutely not be forced to learn
    Git*.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      * I've heard this now so often that this really starts to rub me all the
      wrong ways.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Internal tools often get kind of a different status assigned, may it be from
  ourselves to us, or in a larger context of a company. Bugs get accepted,
  complexities sold as necessities, documentation is pointing to a chat thread,
  calling it a day.
</p>
<p>
  I say no! <strong>Good enough, is just not good.</strong> I should treat
  myself better, my future self, my colleagues, and those that come after.
  Caring about internal tools and those users should be as natural as,
  hopefully, the care given to external users or anyone else.
</p>

<h3 id="but-why">But why?</h3>
<p>
  Better internal tools will result in <strong>less errors</strong>,
  <strong>save time</strong>, and <strong>reduce cost</strong>. Removing
  friction is another reason to even create internal tools in the first place,
  so why only go half way?
</p>
<p>
  A good and comprehensive documentation reduces time searching for answers and
  help. Fewer bugs lead to less frustration, and less time spend working around
  those issues. Happy users are more productive users, if that is me or hundreds
  of others makes no difference.
</p>
<p>
  All this, increasing confidence in a tool, therefore confidence in my own
  abilities, or the ones of my team. Reducing maintenance costs, increasing
  reusability, and getting easier buy-ins later from users, management, or the
  infamous future self.
</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>
  I'll try to be constructive, not only talking about high level concepts, but
  where possible providing specific examples on how to
  <strong>create and improve internal tools</strong>. All of it should work from
  being a single person creating something amazing, to a team working in a
  company, and I'll see to explain how this applies for those cases.
</p>
<p>
  But be aware, this is not an exhaustive list, nor a set of rules. More like
  guiding on what worked for me in the past, from private projects to the years
  of development in companies, small and large. I did not eat wisdom with a
  spoon, though I'm passionate about tool development and want us all to build
  great software and workflows. On top of that, many of the points I'll bring up
  work for general software development as well.
</p>
<p>With that being said, let's build awesome internal tools.</p>

<h3 id="me-user-colleague">
  1. Me, user, colleague &mdash; what's the difference?
</h3>
<p>
  Developing internal tools means, generally speaking, developing for
  colleagues, yourself, or both. Users should not be treated differently because
  of that, though this is often the case. Talking about those tools, starting
  sentences with <em>"This is just for &hellip;"</em>. <strong>Just</strong> for
  whom? The fundamental key in this endeavour, the person or group that will
  work with the tool.
</p>
<p>
  The mindset is important. How we speak, is important. This is not
  <em>just</em>; this is for my amazing users, for my capable colleagues, this
  is for the magnificent me, now and future; always remember.
</p>

<h3 id="ask-and-listen-never-assume">2. Ask and listen, never assume</h3>
<p>
  Too often I see tools developed purely based on assumptions. Assuming how
  something should work, how people work together, what the current process
  looks like. Sometimes going ahead with a great idea, releasing it, not once
  having the actual user had a look at it before.
  <em>Assumptions Driven Development</em>.
</p>
<p>
  This is a problem that can easily be resolved. Even with the greatest of
  ideas, <strong>ask and listen first</strong>. What is really wanted? Where is
  the current problem or friction? What needs to be automated? Planning goes a
  long way, and planning also means getting all the requirements right first, by
  talking to the target audience.
</p>
<p>
  What if this is <em>just</em> me? There it is again, <em>just</em>. Even for
  myself I try to nail down what I really want. Do I need to automate those two
  clicks here? Do I always want to write regular expressions for my most
  powerful search, yet? When I want to extend this software later, is this
  exhaustive plugin system really the right solution? I'm a technical person,
  but is a technical solution what I want?
</p>
<p>
  It may seem obvious reading this, but reality shows it is not.
  <strong>Never assume</strong>, get all requirements, involve users early.
  <em>Just</em> one benefit of internal tool development and reachable users.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, involving users is letting them collaborate early, shaping the future
  of what they will use (probably) daily, increasing the emotional value
  attached to it, and therefore often being more forgiving on bugs or small
  issues.
</p>

<h3 id="watch-them-work">3. Watch them work</h3>
<p>
  Ask and listen is nice, but like a picture says more than 1000 words, watching
  someone work with a tool, workflow, or library can give more insight than any
  question could. Quite often what others see as
  <em>"not worthy to mention"</em> when talking about a workflow can offer great
  potential for optimisation. Important here is to capture this session in any
  capacity, e.g.: written down, pictures taken, a video captured.
</p>
<p>
  Too often I had a colleague skip over the fact they use two different tools
  for almost the same task, for some reason that resulted in saying
  <em>"this is how we always did this"</em>. There is
  <strong>no blame</strong> to the user in this, as
  <strong>long time usage often leads to blind spots</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, how do I watch myself work, creating tools for my own needs? Observe via
  screen recording! Starting a recording and letting it run for a duration of
  time, doing the usual tasks, test a new tool, work on integrating it into an
  existing workflow. And then review the recording. This will help identify
  barriers and reveal blind spots, giving a different perspective.
</p>

<h3 id="the-time-in-between">4. The time in-between</h3>
<p>
  From experience, automation and optimisation of existing workflows and tools
  is not always what brings the biggest benefit. Looking at a day of work, where
  is all the time spend? Is it actually inside a tool, worth the effort to
  reduce four clicks to one, or is it context switching between different tools?
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Often the second, context switching, or glue-work*. If this is the case,
    this is where effort should be spent.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>* Make one thing work with another.</p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Removing time in-between can mean changing the tool landscape or composition.
  Where an old process is three different tools to solve a given task, it can
  become clear that two of those tools are always used together. This offers the
  potential for unification, changing the composition, to
  <strong>remove lost time in context switching</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  If tools cannot be unified, it is worth looking into other ways to reduce
  time. There could be a specific feature needed from one tool that can be
  transferred to another. Even if this means duplication, it can be worth it.
</p>
<p>
  What if inside my tool landscape one tool is owned by another team or person?
  Talk to them, listen, show them the problem and, in the best case, ideas how
  to solve it. Or try working with them on solving the issue. If this is for any
  reason not feasible, or they can or will not help, try a different way.
  Feature duplication, contribute to an external codebase, get creative.
</p>
<p>
  And sometimes, accept what is given. Create documentation about the issue and
  what was tried and discussed, and move on, spending your valuable time
  elsewhere.
</p>

<h3 id="looks-do-matter">5. Looks do matter</h3>
<p>
  There once was a documentation tool from a well-known company. It offered all
  one can dream of; editing without technical knowledge, a visual editor,
  rich-media support, integrations into other tools, even sharing documents with
  external users, and many features more. Yet, no one wanted to use it. People
  even reacted with disgust, calling it a graveyard and worse. Why?, one might
  ask. <strong>It was not sexy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Even if a bit exaggerated, more often than not, looks can be the reason a
  totally capable tool is not accepted by users. What counts as good-looking is
  of course very subjective. The peak of beauty for one, can be jarring for
  others.
</p>
<p>
  When working alone, creating tools for myself, it can be whatever I like most.
  Personally I love a retro futuristic style,
  <a
    href="/blog/cassette-futurism"
    title="My article on what I love about cassette futurism."
    >cassette futurism</a
  >, so I developed a theme and corresponding libraries I can use for all my
  tools. It is a retro pixel style, dark but with brightly coloured accents, and
  otherwise kept very simple. The image of this article shows the exact theme in
  question. I love looking at it, love using my tools.
</p>
<p>
  In a company, for many different users, it can be best to get someone who has
  knowledge forming the <strong>user experience</strong> with design background
  (<abbr title="User Interface Design">UI</abbr>/<abbr
    title="User Experience Design"
    >UX</abbr
  >). Much can be learned and taught, but a professional is a professional
  &mdash; and best utilised from the beginning if available.
</p>
<p>
  If that's no option, there is <strong>no shame in copying</strong> the style
  of others. One of the powers of developing an internal tool is freedom, also
  the freedom to copy. There are many great examples out there that can be
  adapted to your use-case. Alternatively, a theme library can be another
  option.
</p>
<p>
  For the commonly used operating systems, Apple offers a list of great

    title="Design System Repo website with general articles and resources for user interface design."
    >Design System Repo</a
  >
  is another great choice with examples, articles, and tools.
</p>
<p>
  Looks are <strong>not restricted to GUI applications</strong>. A terminal UI
  is UI, too; a CLI can look nice; help text printed via
  <code>--help</code> formatted to be more readable. Even further, error
  messages should <em>"look good"</em>, aka. be very readable by a human.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of directly printing an error, the thought should always be
  <em>"what error message actually helps"</em>. Only showing what is a direct
  help to resolve the problem. There can also be an error code, or an additional
  tool to get further guidance on a problem. And if the user cannot do anything,
  how about not showing an error at all? Try to tell the user what will happen
  next, run a recovery, in the worst case restart, but
  <strong>be transparent</strong>.
</p>

<h3 id="documentation-driven-development">
  6. Documentation Driven Development
</h3>
<p>
  Test driven development is nice, but have you ever tried documentation driven
  development? It is the simple concept of
  <strong>writing the documentation first</strong>, before anything else.
  Specifying how a library is used, a program should work, an API look, a
  <abbr>CLI</abbr> behave &mdash; for the user.
</p>
<p>
  This way of starting a project made the biggest change for my work, to the (a
  lot) better. Usually I started right with writing code, sometimes tests first,
  sometimes not. <strong>Documentation came always later</strong>, always;
  sometimes never.
</p>
<p>
  From the day I started working documentation driven, my tools got better,
  <abbr>APIs</abbr>
  more usable, extendable, and readable. This may sound like an exaggeration,
  but it is not. This really changed how I approach any tool since then.
</p>
<p>
  This works on any scale, too. Creating a new repository, a readme should be
  the first file, filled in and final. How to use the code, or library, in
  detail, for all that is planned. It can also be applied to a single new
  feature for a bigger codebase, or the next iteration of an application.
</p>
<p>
  It makes me really think how I want something to be
  <strong>used in the best possible way</strong> on a detailed level. Being the
  best version of myself, I implement tests next, including all code examples
  from the documentation, if present. Not because someone said this is how I
  should do it, but because it solves my next set of problems, the
  technicalities.
</p>
<p>
  At that point, I have documentation, tests, and a big smile on my face,
  hopefully. No matter how my implementation now looks, it is tested and can be
  used, with an <abbr>API</abbr> I'm actually happy with.
</p>

<h3 id="prototype-iterate-implement">7. Prototype, iterate, implement</h3>
<p>
  Even on internal tooling, tackling a large new application or feature by
  starting of with a prototype is crucial to a successful adoption. A prototype
  in that context can be many things, a dummy created with a design tool,
  screens of what to expect, documentation explaining what will be available,
  going back to the
  <a href="#documentation-driven-development">documentation driven approach</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Important is not what the prototype is, but that it exists, and can be used to
  iterate on, <strong>together with users</strong>. If future users are already
  happy on that stage, they will look forward to actually work with the new tool
  they get, well knowing what to expect.
</p>
<p>
  What if they're not happy? Iterate! Until the point they are. This can feel
  sometimes tedious, is often hard, and can take quite some time. But this
  initial time spend is well worth it, avoiding late conceptual changes and
  bigger refactors.
</p>
<p>
  Some great tools to create visual prototypes are
  <a
    href="https://penpot.app"
    title="Open-source, free, design and prototype tool."
    >Penpot</a
  >, free, open-source, and can even be self-hosted;
  <a href="https://www.figma.com" title="Design and prototype tool.">Figma</a>,
  offering a free tier or a subscription based price; and
  <a href="https://www.sketch.com" title="Design and prototype tool.">Sketch</a
  >, paid with either a monthly subscription or a one time payment, also
  offering free tiers for education.
</p>

<h3 id="interlude">Interlude</h3>
<p>
  At this point, looking at all the previous guiding: The problem space is fully
  understood, the documentation already written, a prototype approved by happy
  users, who look forward on getting a new shiny toy, tests maybe implemented as
  well, giving the tool implementer the highest confidence to actually go into
  development.
</p>
<p>
  This may sound like an unreachable scenario, and as context is everything, it
  sometimes is, but it is a scenario to strive for. In the end, as guidelines
  go, it is all about picking what works best for a given situation.
</p>

<h3 id="imagine-going-public">8. Imagine going public</h3>
<p>
  A small mental exercise, look at an existing <strong>internal tool</strong>,
  and think about what would need to be done to <strong>go-public</strong>. Is
  it a lot? Usual candidates are missing documentation, a user experience to be
  improved, or no way to monitor if everything actually works.
</p>
<p>
  This is <strong>not about actually going public</strong>, as a lot of internal
  tools cover company internal processes or are integrated into systems that can
  not be disclosed for any reason. This is purely about the <em>what-if</em>,
  from a user perspective, and the therefore emerging question of <em>Why?</em>
</p>
<p>
  Can my colleagues not get the best experience &mdash; can I? Why is that?
  Thinking about what is necessary to go-public can be a valuable exercise to
  harden and improve a tool. One of those, often neglected, is monitoring.
</p>

<h3 id="monitor">9. Monitor</h3>
<p>
  Why should I monitor a tool used by a few? They will <em>just</em> write me
  when something does not work, won't they? Often not. For every user that wrote
  a bug ticket or in a chat, even more did not. Sometimes they find creative
  solutions, working around a problem or limitation of a tool, in the end
  spending more time over all.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Monitoring will help</strong> catch this, early. Having a central
  place for where your logs go, observing application performance, receiving
  alerts on errors, recording user sessions when problems keep them stuck. There
  are many aspects of monitoring, and it all depends on the needs and goals set.
</p>
<p>
  It is valuable to gather information, to help the users, to solve problems
  quicker, and catch errors early. The more robust and hardened the software,
  the smaller the maintenance cost, saving time for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  In my past I had some great experience with
  <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com" title="Datadog monitoring and alerting."
    >Datadog</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://sentry.io/"
    title="Sentry website, a tool for monitoring software."
    >Sentry</a
  >, both great tools to support different monitoring needs. To be fair, always
  in a context of multiple users, not when I worked on my own.
</p>

<h3 id="how-to-replace-existing-tools">10. How to replace existing tools?</h3>
<p>
  This is the tricky one, and quite often the hardest requirement. Creating a
  new tool, to replace one or more in existence. There can be many reasons why a
  full replacement is needed, and before even considering there should always be
  evaluated if one or more tools can be refactored or improved instead, but when
  the decision is made, a big task lures ahead.
</p>
<p>
  An often very optimistic view is that a subset of features on a new tool will
  be enough to start replacing the existing one. This is not true, a new tool
  will need <strong>feature parity to get user acceptance</strong>. If this is
  not the case, users will, when having the option, continue using the old tool
  and workflow.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to bring users over to a not yet fully feature complete
  replacement, when providing a clear benefit that makes it worth it with a
  subset of the functionality. Nevertheless, all previous tasks need to be
  solvable in some capacity, with the old tool, a temporary alternative, or a
  new minimal version of what already is in place.
</p>
<p>
  What does help while developing the replacement in parallel is a
  <strong>feature freeze on the old tool</strong>. It is also well worth to
  reuse what possible, enabling a faster go-to-user. Reusing not only means code
  or design, it can also be a data format. Being able to run new and old in
  parallel is a huge benefit in this transition period.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of approach, the main goal needs to be that the new tool does
  provide a clear benefit, not just recreating what already existed (<a
    href="#watch-them-work"
    >see point 3</a
  >), with a <strong>100% adoption rate</strong>. Not planning to sunset the old
  tool is a mistake that will increase maintenance cost.
</p>

<h3 id="a-new-release">11. A new release</h3>
<p>
  Rolling out a new release should be done with
  <strong>confidence and transparency</strong>. Confidence in having a setup
  that allows easy rollouts of new features to all users and being transparent
  in what will be released by announcing the changes. A good changelog will make
  a difference.
</p>
<p>
  Changelog generation is a very common practice, by taking commit messages and
  packing them into a list of changes. Often done with tools like
  <a
    href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/"
    title="Commitizen is release management tool designed for teams."
    >Commitizen</a
  >, where commit message rules define change log categories and content.
  <strong>I would not use this</strong> targeting users.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of generated changelog is very technical, may be useful for
  developers working on a tool, but <strong>not the end user</strong>. A good
  user changelog is human-readable, with focus on explaining or even showing new
  features, and what user reported issues were fixed.
</p>
<p>
  It doesn't even need to be complicated, or a lot of text &mdash; images or a
  recordings go even further. Anything that helps your user understand what is
  new and how it works, maybe even making them excited to try out the new
  release.
</p>

<h3 id="you-are-never-really-done">12. You're never really done</h3>
<p>
  Ever heard <em>"When we finish this tool we build the next"</em>? You're never
  done. Every new tool is a new responsibility. Fixing bugs, supporting new
  operating systems, adding features. Saying one is done equals abandonment.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a problem, but an opportunity &mdash; instead of creating a new
  tool, an existing one can be extended. Alternatively, maybe there is something
  <em>"off the shelf"</em>. Before creating new, all options need to be
  considered.
</p>
<p>
  Now, when creating a new tool and keeping future responsibility in mind,
  extensibility should be considered. Giving the user methods to extend the
  tool, write plugins, create visual extensions, support admin roles that can
  configure aspects for others. Generally, making it possible for users to solve
  new problems with what is given.
</p>

<h3 id="above-and-beyond">13. Above and Beyond</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Going the extra mile is worth it.</strong> As said in the beginning:
  <em>Good enough, is just not good</em>. Of course this is not always the case,
  but we should all challenge ourselves to really go above and beyond.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Thinking from the users perspective; fixing bugs, for example with
    reoccurring bug squashing days; getting regular feedback, this could be done
    by sending out short user surveys*; removing friction by looking at the time
