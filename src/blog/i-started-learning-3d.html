<h3>Going through tutorials</h3>
<p>
  One day I thought why not learn some 3D art, and
  <a href="https://blender.org" title="Official Blender website">Blender</a>
  was the Open Source program of my choice. To get myself started I decided to
  work through a bunch of tutorials &mdash; the first one being the famous

  playlist:

  Next I tried myself on a

  and photo-realism. The result, as seen below, really hooked me for the whole
  3D thing.

<h3>Overestimating myself</h3>
<p>
  After doing those tutorials, I thought immediately that
  <em>"I can tackle a bigger project"</em>. Why not an
  <a

    title="Wikipedia page for Alien the movie."
    >Alien</a

  inspired spaceship interior. I love the
  <a

    title="Some appreciation about an art style called Cassette Futurism."
    >Cassette Futurism</a
  >
  seen in the movie, the aesthetics, and the grounded feel of it all. I opened a
  new Blender file and &hellip;
</p>
<p><strong>Nope.</strong> Not happening. Nothing I can tackle, yet.</p>
<h3>Being realistic</h3>
<p>
  After reconsidering my skills, lowering them, a lot, I came up with some new
  ideas I can work on. Learning light, creating small studies with abstract
  forms and some pleasing colors; baby steps so to speak (even though I still
  want to create the spaceship one day). Here are some of those studies I made,
  with the best of my knowledge and skill:
