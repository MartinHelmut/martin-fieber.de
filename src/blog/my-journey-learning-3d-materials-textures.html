<h3>A long way ahead</h3>
<p>
  When I finished
  <a
    href="/blog/bulkhead-door-with-blender-part-1"
    title="Part one of the series about my journey learning 3D."
    >part one of creating Ron Cobb's bulkhead door from Alien</a
  >, I thought a second part would be all that was left to finish the project.
  My assumption was that textures, animation, and sound would be as much work as
  creating the initial mesh, from high to low-poly, including
  <abbr>UV</abbr> unwrapping and baking &mdash;
  <strong>I could not have been more wrong.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What was intended to be a two-part series is becoming
  <strong>five parts</strong>, with this being part two, focusing on texturing
  and details and the things I had to do again to get to this point.
</p>
<p>
  For once, I had to rework parts of my mesh as my topology was horrible. I also
  started applying booleans earlier and was less scared of using a destructive
  workflow. The initial idea was to have a simple way of going from a high to a
  low-poly mesh by deactivating booleans. Though this did not turn out to be a
  time saver, I had to go in and adjust parts of both meshes afterward
  regardless.
</p>
<p>
  What really took my fear of working destructively on the mesh away were
  add-ons like
  <a
    href="https://machin3.io/MESHmachine/"
    title="Landing page for MESHmachine, a Blender mesh modelling add-on."
    >MESHmachine</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://blendermarket.com/products/machin3tools"
    title="Show MACHIN3tools on BlenderMarket"
    >MACHIN3tools</a
  >, which provided a multitude of helpful tools and shortcuts. On top of that,
  I got more experience in Blender over time, as I was working on other models
  as well, learning much more on many topics. An amazingly large field with
  engaging challenges to overcome.
</p>

<div class="side-note-ref">
  <h3>New Topo*, new me</h3>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      *<abbr>Topo</abbr> = <dfn>Topology</dfn>, refers to the flow of geometry
      used to construct a 3D model.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  <em>With great topology comes great possibilities</em>, and I had none. Due to
  mainly using a boolean workflow, which gives me quick results, I omitted being
  more cautious with my mesh topology, combined with being inexperienced in 3D
  modeling. My shading sure looked okay for what I was able to judge, but I was
  not able to add bevels to the model, and my UVs were suboptimal at best.
</p>
<p>
  Using a
  <strong>boolean-heavy workflow is not the issue</strong>
  here; it is how I worked with it. In the end, I sat down and reworked many
  parts of my mesh, resulting in a better (but not optimal) mesh topology with
  clean shading.

    The new and improved topology of the mesh is getting better, step by step.

<p>
  This now gave me the option to bevel my hard edges, creating a mesh I was much
  happier with.

  <figcaption>
    Now the mesh has beveled edges (left) and with much better shading (right).
  </figcaption>

<p>
  Reworking the topology and adding beveled edges meant I had to go through all
  the previous steps again &mdash; starting with creating a low-poly version of
  my mesh.

<p>Of to baking &hellip;</p>

<h3>Material preparation and bake</h3>
<p>
  This time, I wanted to get better bake results and make applying textures
  later easier for myself. What I missed the last time was a
  <strong>material ID map</strong>, a mistake I wanted to resolve now. For this,
  I did add colored materials to the high-poly mesh in Blender to
  <em>"bake down"</em> onto the low-poly mesh in
  <a href="https://marmoset.co" title="Marmoset website">Marmoset Toolbag 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Baking in Marmoset, this time giving myself more time to make it proper.
  Specifically, in part one, I had some <em>"black fragments"</em> on my mesh. I
  found out this is an issue with inset parts and the automatic offset cage
  applied by Marmoset. The offset cage should extend far enough to cover the
  highest points of the high-poly mesh, and it did not wherever I had those
  fragments.
</p>
<figure>

      src="/assets/blog/bulkhead-door-part2/baking-black-spots.png"

      height="650"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>Some parts of my mesh had those strange black parts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To fix this, I had to paint the offset, <strong>extending the cage</strong>,
  to capture all the detail of the mesh.

      loading="lazy"

  </picture>
  <figcaption>Changing the offset cage to capture all the detail.</figcaption>

<p>
  After having this done and re-baking the mesh, I got rid of the black spots on
  my mesh.

      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>
    After adjusting the offset cage, the black fragments were gone.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  It still took me a while to
  <strong>fix more offset and skew issues</strong>, as seen in the images above.
  The people behind Marmoset created an
  <a
    href="https://marmoset.co/posts/toolbag-baking-tutorial/"
    title="Everything needed around baking in Marmoset Toolbag 4."
    >amazing tutorial for baking in Marmoset</a
  >, covering everything needed and more to get the best bake, including common
  issues and what all exported maps actually do. This was a real lifesaver for
  me, densely packed with information &mdash; I'm still learning from it on
  every new bake.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, having learned so much more in the process, it is finally time
  to create the textures.
</p>

<h3>Hurrah, textures!</h3>
<p>
  The time has come to give proper material to the bulkhead door, but how and
  what? First things first, I tried to find out what material the door could
  use. Searching the internet and looking at Ron Cobb's drawings, movie
  references from Alien, and pictures from cargo ship interiors, I came to the
  conclusion it could be an <strong>aluminum alloy, painted white</strong>, with
  partial signs of use on the edges.
</p>
<figure>
  <picture>
    <img
      src="/assets/blog/bulkhead-door-part2/bulkhead-door-references.png"
      alt="From left to right: Ron Cobb's sketch of the door, an image of the interior of a cargo ship, and the bulkhead door from the movie Alien."
      width="1024"

      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>

    of a cargo ship, and the bulkhead door from the movie Alien.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Cargo ships use a lot of steel and aluminum alloys; steel being heavy makes
  the aluminum alloy a better candidate; it is also used in space travel as of
  today. The white paint would serve as a protective coating that wears off over
  time but can easily be replaced.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    Having everything easily repairable even with limited tools &mdash; less
    moving parts, fewer electronics, higher chance to run cheaper, longer, on
    fewer people. Just paint the walls and hull white again, and you're good to
    go. Throw some duct tape on it, and the rattle stops. That kind of
    mentality, but in the usual high-tech genre.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      I thought this would be a fitting in-universe explanation for Alien and
      the cassette futurism in space travel.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  That's what I wanted to recreate then &mdash; an aluminum alloy, painted white
  and visibly worn. To do this, I wanted to try a few different tools:
  <strong>Quixel Mixer</strong>, a free tool by Epic;
  <strong>Marmoset Toolbag 4</strong>, which I already use for baking and has
  texturing support as well; and <strong>Fluent: Materializer</strong>, a
  Blender add-on with a node-based procedural texturing workflow.
</p>

<h3>Quixel Mixer</h3>
<figure>

    <img
      src="/assets/blog/bulkhead-door-part2/tool-banner-quixel-mixer.png"
      alt="Banner showing the logo of Quixel Mixer."

      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
</figure>
<p>
  <a href="https://quixel.com/mixer" title="Quixel Mixer website"
    >Epic's Quixel Mixer</a
  >
  is a free tool to create textures. I've read about it being easy to use while
  getting amazing results. And I'd say, at first glance, it
  <strong>can absolutely deliver</strong>. The interface is very clean and
  sorted, most of the functions self-explanatory, and for someone knowing
  typical graphics programs like Affinity Designer quick to understand, at least
  that is how I felt.
</p>
<figure>
  <picture>
    <img
      src="/assets/blog/bulkhead-door-part2/quixel-mixer.png"
      alt="Image showing the bulkhead door open in Quixel Mixer."
      width="1024"
      height="600"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>Quixel Mixer has a really nice interface.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  After getting my mesh and baked maps into the tool, I was ready to start
  applying predefined materials to it based on my material ID map. The
  <strong>layer based approach</strong> felt intuitive, and I got some pretty
  good results in a short amount of time. Those results did not match what I set
  out to recreate yet, but putting more work in there I can surely get there.
</p>
<p>
  Though, this is where the <strong>problems started</strong>, at least on my
  MacBook Air with the M1 chip I mainly work on. The program became more and
  more unresponsive with every added layer; making small changes froze the tool,
  resulting in waiting times between every edit I made. In two cases, Quixel
  Mixer even crashed, and I had to force quit the program.
</p>
<p>
  Due to those problems, <strong>I did not continue using Quixel Mixer</strong>,
  sadly, as I really liked the intuitive controls. Maybe I should try using it
  again on a Windows machine or give it some time to iron out those problems.
  It's definitely not the last time I try Epic's tool.
</p>

<h3>Marmoset Toolbag 4</h3>
<figure>
  <picture>
    <img
      src="/assets/blog/bulkhead-door-part2/tool-banner-marmoset.png"
      alt="Banner showing the logo of Marmoset Toolbag 4."
      width="1024"
      height="300"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
</figure>
<p>
  Next up, I wanted to dive into the texturing tools of
  <a href="https://marmoset.co/toolbag/" title="Website for Marmoset Toolbag"
    >Marmoset Toolbag 4</a
  >. I already knew some parts of the <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> of
  Marmoset as I use it for baking, and I also knew that the program is
  absolutely fast and snappy. So far, I have not had one issue or slowdown, not
  a single crash.
</p>
<p>
  On top of that, there are
  <a
    href="https://marmoset.co/resources/"
    title="A collection of tutorials around Marmoset."
    >amazing tutorials</a
  >
  covering everything needed, from baking to texturing, <abbr>UI</abbr>,
  rendering, and even shaders. Going through some of those tutorials, I started
  working on creating textures for the bulkhead door.
</p>
<figure>
  <picture>

      height="569"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>Texturing tools of Marmoset Toolbag 4.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  As I had a project already set up from the baking, I could switch to the
  <em>"Texture"</em> tab and keep going. Figuring out what is necessary to
  create the textures I wanted using a <strong>layer-based approach</strong>
  with a huge set of predefined materials. Though, I could not create something
  that made me happy. One hurdle for me, the interface, more or less the
  opposite to Quixel Mixer, is very detailed and functional, almost overwhelming
  me with options.
</p>
<p>
  I think to really leverage the power of Marmoset I need much more time with
  it, going through more tutorials, and trying to recreate other textures. This
  is what I will do, continuously, to deep-dive into it. For now,
  <strong>I closed the program</strong>, as I wanted to try another way of
  creating my textures for the door.
</p>

<h3>Fluent: Materializer</h3>
<figure>

    <img

  <a
    href="https://blendermarket.com/products/fluent-materializer"
    title="BlenderMarket page for the Fluent: Materializer add-on."
    >Fluent: Materializer</a
  >
  calls itself a <em>material tool suite</em>, a Blender add-on that, instead of
  using predefined materials to create textures, is about creating materials
  itself. Building on top of Blender's shading nodes, it serves as a way to
  streamline the creation of procedural materials.
</p>

      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>Some example nodes from the add-on.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  This way of creating my own materials with a
  <strong>node-based workflow</strong> really stuck with me. I felt comfortable
  right away &mdash; creating materials based on my gathered references without
  too many issues.
</p>

      height="515"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </picture>
  <figcaption>A first test render of the door.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Not only that, I was able to create something
  <strong>I was finally happy</strong> with. From the base material of the door,
  the white painted aluminum alloy with worn edges, to the warning lights with a
  reflector pattern around the frame, things started to look as I wanted them
  to.
</p>
<div class="side-note-ref">
  <p>
    I did stick to it for this project, creating all the materials I wanted and
    even some variants later on. Nevertheless,
    <strong>one issue I have is the documentation</strong>; other tools set a
    good standard that Fluent: Materializer just cannot reach, with missing
    information about many of its features. I would really wish for the add-on
    to get better documentation, going in-depth about all its features.
  </p>
  <aside class="side-note">
    <p>
      <strong>New:</strong> There is now a partial documentation under
      <a
        href="https://cgthoughts.com/fluent/materializer/doc/"
        title="Documentation website for Fluent: Materializer."
        >cgthoughts.com</a
      >
      covering special nodes and decals.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>
<p>
  Overall, I'm still very happy with the add-on, which enables me to iterate
  quickly on my materials. All I needed next was some more detail.
</p>

<h3>Details, decals, and determination</h3>
<p>
  Now that my materials sparked joy, I wanted to add more detail to my mesh,
  including the numbering above the bulkhead door as well as some screws on the
  door. To do this, I already knew I wanted to use
  <a
    href="https://machin3.io/DECALmachine/"
    title="Landing page for DECALmachine, a decal and trim-sheet Blender add-on."
    >DECALmachine</a
  >
  &mdash; an absolutely amazing Blender add-on I do not want to miss anymore.
</p>
<p>
  With it, I was able to quickly add mesh decals, in a fast and intuitive way.
  For the screws on the main door, I used some of the decals that came with the
  add-on. For info decals, like the numbering on the frame or the warning text
  on the barrier doors, I created my own.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Without leaving Blender</strong>, I was able to quickly set up my
  decals. The number is from a loaded font, using a similar one to the one Ron
  Cobb used in his drawing; the warning label is from geometry and text I
  quickly threw together in Blender.
</p>

  <figcaption>Creating decals right inside Blender.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  As a result of <strong>decal creation being that effortless</strong>, I will
  definitely build up my decal library over time. It was a very fun process that
  immediately triggered new ideas in my mind for more details I wanted to
  create.
</p>
<p>Having a set of decals created, I added them to my mesh.</p>

<p>
  To remove the clean look, I added a grunge map from Fluent: Materializer to
  the alpha input of the info decal group node, adding some wear and tear.

  <a
    href="https://machin3.io"
    title="MACHIN3 website with all the tools and references."
    >MACHIN3</a
  >
  tools is the documentation. Every single tool has a documentation website,
  FAQ, changelog, and even videos showing existing and new features alike.
  Effectively the reason that tools like <em>DECALmachine</em> and
  <em>MESHmachine</em> became essential for me in no time.

<p>Now, without further ado, the textured bulkhead door.</p>

  This is it &mdash;
  <strong>my first model I created and textured myself</strong>, not following a
  tutorial, applying what I learned, and learning a hundred more things while
  doing it. I'm indeed very happy with the result, even though I see many little
  things I would want to change or do differently if I did it again.
  Nevertheless, I already invested <b class="emphasize">a lot</b> of time into
  this, and I need to continue, so I can someday actually finish everything I
  set out to do.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to recreate not the bulkhead door from Alien (1979), but the door
  from

    title="Ron Cobb's website with a gallery of pictured he made for Alien."
    >the drawing of Ron Cobb he did for the movie</a
  >. Here's a look at how my mesh stacks up to it.

<p>
  I will do it and say it (or rather write it) &mdash; I for myself, consider
  this an absolute success.
</p>

<h3>Experiments</h3>
<p>
  Having reached my goal, I wanted to try <strong>my own take</strong> on the
  door textures going forward. Even though I like the white style, I thought a
  darker tone for the frame would add a nice contrast to it all.

  I also wanted to add some more writing to the door, as I thought this would
  help make it feel more real. So I quickly created some more warning decals
  with <em>DECALmachine</em>; this really took me just a couple of minutes.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  What a ride, that is not even done yet. Even though this
  <strong>took me way longer</strong> and <strong>was way harder</strong> than I
  thought, I learned a tremendous amount of things and had so much
  <strong>fun and joy</strong> while doing it. I'm for sure not happy with
  everything and would do a lot differently now, but I take it as how far I've
  come and learned on my 3D journey until now.
</p>
<p>
  On future hard-surface projects, I would like to explore a mid-poly workflow,
  skipping the high-to-low-poly conversion, using weighted normals. I also need
  to get better with my <abbr>UVs</abbr>. But that is for sure something for
  future me. For now, I cannot wait to continue learning more about what comes
  next.
</p>

<h3>What comes next?</h3>
<p>
  So far, I <em>"only"</em> rendered pretty pictures of the door. Next up, I
  want to have some animation; for this, I will learn
  <strong>to rig</strong> and then <strong>animate the door</strong> in Blender.
  But I will also explore how to export this to game engines to get a complete
  workflow going.
</p>
<p>
  That will continue in
